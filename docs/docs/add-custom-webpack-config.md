title: "Add custom webpack config"
---

_Before creating custom webpack configuration, check to see if there's a Gatsby
plugin already built that handles your use case in the [plugins section](/docs/plugins/).
If there's not yet one and your use case is a general one, we highly encourage
you to contribute back your plugin to the Gatsby repo so it's available to
others (including your future self ðŸ˜€)._

To add custom webpack configurations, create (if there's not one already)
a `gatsby-node.js` file in your root directory.  Inside this file, export a function called `modifyWebpackConfig`.

When Gatsby creates its webpack config, this function will be called allowing you to modify the default
webpack config using [webpack-configurator](https://github.com/lewie9021/webpack-configurator).

Gatsby does multiple webpack builds with somewhat different configuration. We
call each build type a "stage". The following stages exist:

1. develop: when running the `gatsby develop` command. Has configuration for hot reloading and CSS injection into page
2. develop-html: same as develop but without react-hmre in the babel config for rendering the HTML component.
3. build-css: production build of CSS
4. build-html: production build static HTML pages
5. build-javascript: production JavaScript build. Creates route bundles as well as a `commons` and `app bundle`.

Check [webpack.config.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby/src/utils/webpack.config.js) for the source.

There are many plugins in the Gatsby repo using this API to look to for examples e.g. [Sass](/packages/gatsby-plugin-sass/), [Typescript](/packages/gatsby-plugin-typescript/), [Glamor](/packages/gatsby-plugin-glamor/), and many more!


## Example

Here is an example adding support for **flexboxgrid** when processing css files.

```js
exports.modifyWebpackConfig = ({ config, stage }) => {
  switch (stage) {
    case 'develop':
      config.loader('css', {
        include: /flexboxgrid/,
      });

      break;

    case 'build-css':
      config.loader('css', {
        include: /flexboxgrid/,
      });

      break;

    case 'build-html':
      config.loader('css', {
        include: /flexboxgrid/,
      });

      break;

    case 'build-javascript':
      config.loader('css', {
        include: /flexboxgrid/,
      });

      break;
  }

  return config;
};
```
