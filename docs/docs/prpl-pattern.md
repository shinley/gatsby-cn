title: PRPL Pattern
---

PRPL is a web site architecture developed by Google for building websites and
apps that work exceptionally well on smartphones and other devices with
unreliable network connections.

PRPL stands for:

* **Push** critical resources for the initial URL route using `<link preload>` and http/2.
* **Render** initial route.
* **Pre-cache** remaining routes.
* **Lazy-load** and create remaining routes on demand.

_**Note** http/2 push is a developing server technology and not available on most hosts just
yet._

Gatsby follows the PRPL architectural pattern. Gatsby sites *render* a static HTML version of the initial route and then load the code bundle for the page. Then immediately starts *pre-caching* resources for pages
linked to from the initial route. When a user clicks on a link, Gatsby creates the new page *on demand* on
the client.

This issue written at the start of Gatsby's 1.0 work provides further background on how
Gatsby works to guarantee high performance.
