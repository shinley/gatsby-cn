blog.</p>\\n<p>Instead of quickly picking an already built theme with a lot of code I might not use—which I did during the previous migration from Medium to Hugo—this time, I decided to take a different route—building it from scratch.</p>\\n<p>I focused on the process, looking for ways to make site building more generic and reusable.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Content migration</li>\\n<li>Programatic

provide high-level guidelines about patterns which can be applied in migrations from other static site generators to Gatsby.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"background-before-you-start\\\"><a

I think today it’s still more mature and closer to classical CMS comparing to Gatsby workflows.</p>\\n<p>As it’s an older ecosystem, when you need a ready plugin or a theme for quick gratification, it’s more likely to find something ready online for Hugo.</p>\\n<p>Gatsby, on the other hand, is based on React, GraphQL, Webpack and its way of thinking is closer to how a developer would approach the problems from a single-page-application point of view.</p>\\n<p>Gatsby might feel a bit more “raw”—there are starters and typography.js, but not so many ready made solutions in the conventional sense. Probably the closest marketplace for themes compared to others is <a href=\\\"https://gatsbythemes.com/\\\">gatsbythemes</a> which is a young project.</p>\\n<p>If you have landed at this article researching which tool is better for your job, take a look at <a href=\\\"https://www.slant.co/versus/1016/18503/~hugo_vs_gatsby-js\\\">comparisons</a> and keep in mind that selecting a <a href=\\\"https://stackshare.io/stackups/gatsby-vs-hugo\\\">stack</a> boils down to being effective with it.</p>\\n<p>For me, using Gatsby is <a href=\\\"https://kalinchernev.github.io/learn-gatsbyjs\\\">valuable learning experience</a> and it has also been so easy to work with, it feels “unfair”. For example, the plugin system of Gatsby keeps me sane and productive, even in cases where I know only the briefest overview concepts of Webpack. Without Gatsby, I might have spent hours and days configuring what Gatsby provides out of the box.</p>\\n<p>Last, but not least, the biggest benefit of using Gatsby compared to Hugo, is the JavaScript tool-chain. Important tasks such as making a progressive web app, hot module reloading, etc are much easier in comparison to other static site generators.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"content-migration\\\"><a href=\\\"#content-migration\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Content migration</h3>\\n<p>This task was easier than expected. The file structure is preserved between my previous blog and the current version. Both Hugo and Gatsby work well when markdown files are stored at a <code>content/post</code> folder.</p>\\n<p>The only work I had to do on the content migration was to reformat the <a href=\\\"https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/\\\">frontmatter</a>. In Hugo, I used TOML, whereas <code>gatsby-transformer-remark</code> works only with YAML for the moment. Luckily, I still had the Hugo CLI on my system so could make use of its <a href=\\\"https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_convert_toyaml/\\\">build-in conversion tool</a>.

Finally I could write structured code to create full web applications for our users. And with Backbone.js and Node.js, a new dream started to emerge, a website that starts rendering on the server side and continues to render on the users’ browsers.</p>\\n<p>I spent days and nights trying to build a generic isomorphic web framework that starts with server side rendering (SSR) and then continues work in the browser. It was difficult to design and I could only make it meet the use case of my company—with lots of small hacks to get the job done. Airbnb made a shot at building such a framework as well with <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rendrjs/rendr\\\">rendr</a>. It was the closest thing to a Backbone.js isomorphic web framework, but it didn’t support the full features of Backbone.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://reactjs.org\\\">React</a> was the game changer. It was better suited to building universal apps since its core idea is mapping state to DOM, or in the server rendering case, state to an HTML string. But still, making React render on the server side and then rehydrating it on the client side includes solving many edge cases, messy configuration, and cryptic knowledge of Babel and webpack.</p>\\n<p>So universal web apps are great but hard. And even when you do get universal React working, SSR can be super slow and CPU intensive so it’ll often hog the Node.js event loop. Even after lots of optimizing, our team’s ultimate solution is always caching.</p>\\n<p>But why dynamically rendered content just to cache it when you can just pre-cache everything? AKA static websites?</p>\\n<p>This is what Gatsby enables. It makes it trivial to build React websites as pre-cached/built static websites.</p>\\n<p>I love static websites. That’s how we all started building websites, right? For me it was an online editor of <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities\\\">GeoCities</a> and that was all we needed back then. Why not go back to static websites? They are fast, scalable, secure and eliminate time consuming devops work.</p>\\n<p>Static websites aren’t a great fit for everything. Full webapps behind login can be fully rendered on the client side so see small benefit from static rendering since each visit is personalized. Serving a statically rendered “shell” for the website could help with perceived performance, but… let’s get back to talking about static websites and leave discussing web apps for another time.</p>\\n<p>Sprinkling JavaScript on a static website can be tricky, but Gatsby does this so well with React that you don’t have to think about it at all—it just works. I used to tweak my configuration all the time to achieve better performance, but Gatsby allows me to outsource the configuration and optimization and get a super fast website with zero work.</p>\\n<p>I’ll also mention <a href=\\\"https://github.com/zeit/next.js\\\">next.js</a> which is quite similar and supports both SSR for dynamic content and exporting to static pages. And don’t forget <a href=\\\"https://www.netlify.com\\\">Netlify</a> who is doing an amazing job at building and hosting static websites.</p>\\n<p>It is so much easier and fun to code for the web today. I would haved saved a lot of development/devops hours at my previous startup just by using Gatsby.

However, at <a href=\\\"https://indigotree.co.uk\\\" title=\\\"Indigo Tree: We Build Awesome Websites\\\">Indigo Tree</a> we’re branching out from our staple of WordPress and trying different methods of creating websites with functionality that our clients require, whilst maximising their budget.</p>\\n<p>We’re also bracing ourselves for what we’re anticipating to be the stormfront of <a href=\\\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\\\" title=\\\"Gutenberg Wordpress plugins\\\">Gutenberg</a> for our WordPress projects. Once it’s included in the WordPress Core, writing components in JavaScript for the Gutenberg editor will be necessary for every developer on a project.</p>\\n<p>So I decided to dive into learning React with a few courses and some experimentation.

So I tried not to be bothered by the templating weirdness too much and embrace the differences. My classes soon became <code>classNames</code>s, my <code>&#x3C;a></code> tags became <code>&#x3C;Links></code>, and I quickly saw what people had been enthusing about.</p>\\n<p>Managing everything in one place is such a cathartic experience.</p>\\n<p>With WordPress templating, I used to have function files, filter files, template files, and SASS partials, often with similar names, depending on the framework I’d be using. To build a site meant needing to buffer the entire project in my short-term memory. Not an easy feat to manage.</p>\\n<p>And then you would complete a project, and forget it all entirely. Until it went to the client…</p>\\n<p>Every time a client returned with a last-minute change, I would open up the code (which I might not have touched for weeks or months), and try to grok what function lived where, or what I had called that SASS partial. Even with the help of browser dev tools, this can be really annoying.</p>\\n<p>Now with Gatsby and React, I have my logic in one language, and in a way that makes groking easier. I have my layout, template and config modules at hand in the folder structure, without duplication.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> React <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&quot;react&quot;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Template for blog page</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">default</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> data <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> post <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> data<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>markdownRemark\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span>div<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span>h1<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&gt;</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>post<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>frontmatter<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>title<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">/</span>h1<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span>div dangerouslySetInnerHTML<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> __html<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> post<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>html <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">/</span>div<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// The data query</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> query <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> graphql<span class=\\\"token template-string\\\"><span class=\\\"token string\\\">`\\n  query BlogPostQuery($slug: String!) {\\n    markdownRemark(fields: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {\\n      html\\n      frontmatter {\\n        title\\n        type\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n`</span></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Whilst this might <em>look</em> weird, it actually makes it much easier to understand what’s going on.

Like SQL, you use GraphQL to query your data, whether from the WordPress API, Contentful or Markdown, and extract a dataset to display in your template.</p>\\n<p>This approach to data is really adaptable. I love the fact that you can install a plugin and query your API endpoints with such ease.</p>\\n<p>Gatsby.js comes with GraphiQL, which is a simple web-based IDE so you can query your data and get back examples of content immediately. You can then copy this query into your React module and get back the information you need, whether it’s the title, content, featured image, categories or any other frontmatter you might have set up.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> query <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> graphql<span class=\\\"token template-string\\\"><span class=\\\"token string\\\">`\\n  query BlogPostQuery($slug: String!) {\\n    markdownRemark(fields: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {\\n      html\\n      frontmatter {\\n        title\\n        type\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }`</span></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Aside from those pesky tick characters, which are sometimes hard to spot for a newbie, I think this is a great tool, and has sped up my development a significant amount.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"css-in-js\\\"><a href=\\\"#css-in-js\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>CSS in JS</h2>\\n<p>This is the thing that I found hardest about React.

With server-side React, we no longer have a dependency on frontend JavaScript, so progressive enhancement is not just a possibility but a standard. There’s momentum towards better accessibility, and for me as a developer, the tools are there (such as Babel, Chrome Dev Tools React extension, and others) for a faster, more efficient development experience.</p>\\n<p>I’m glad to say I’m sold on the idea and methods of developing with JavaScript, and React in particular.

We’ll also sleep better at night knowing insecurities in WordPress are no longer putting our clients at risk.</p>\\n<p>The web is always changing. And the way forward isn’t always easy to see.

I might write <code>&#x3C;h1>{t(hello)}</code> (more on this later), and the user would see ‘Hello’, ‘Bonjour’, or ‘Hola’ depending on what language they had switched to, and whether we’d added a translation for it.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"tip-a-quick-note-on-language-codes\\\"><a href=\\\"#tip-a-quick-note-on-language-codes\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>TIP: A quick note on language codes</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.science.co.il/language/Codes.php\\\">Each language has a unique code</a>. We use this code to reference a language in our code. If you see a hyphen and then some letters after it, they refer to the locale. So for example:</p>\\n<p>en = English cy = Welsh es = Spanish en-GB = British English en-US = American English</p>\\n<p>The locale allows us to make changes to spelling (for example, “colour” vs. “color”), but can also be used for other functions such as currency.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"working-with-translators\\\"><a href=\\\"#working-with-translators\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Working with translators</h2>\\n<p>At doopoll we speak multiple languages, but just like design, development, and copywriting, translation requires time and skill to get it right. That’s why we work with our awesome friends at <a href=\\\"https://applingua.com/\\\">Applingua</a> who handle all of our translation, and push new strings straight to our Git Repo </p>\\n<p>There are other options out there. You can even crowd source your translations! However, in our experience, if you’re going to be updating your site regularly it pays to build a good working relationship with a translator.

writing this on a Saturday afternoon so I’ll cheat a bit and just cut the gordian knot by saying “simplicity is fun” and conversely, “complexity is not fun”.</p>\\n<p>Every one loves new projects. Why? Because they’re simple! We can dive in and experiment and reliably get something done. The more complex the project, the more things seem to break, the more time gets wasted on various yak shaves, and critically, the gap between thinking up an idea and being able to try it grows larger and larger.</p>\\n<p>Fred Brooks wrote in his classic book <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination.

We work on the largest platform that has ever existed. Tools like <a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io/\\\">Babel</a> let us easily experiment with new syntax. <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/seek-blog/a-unified-styling-language-d0c208de2660\\\">CSS-in-JS</a> enables entirely new ways of thinking about styles and theming. Browser vendors are pushing hard to improve all parts of the web platform. There’s never been a better time to re-examine old doctrines and try audacious experiments. Radical improvements to the web are waiting us.</p>\\n<p>Gatsby’s claim is that a React website, built with our highly performant React component building blocks and compiled by Gatsby, is faster than all but the most tightly tuned, hand-crafted websites and at a <em>tiny</em> fraction of the effort.</p>\\n<p>And I think we’re just getting started. Come join us and help design and write the building blocks for the fastest possible websites which take the least amount of effort.</p>\",\"excerpt\":\"I still remember the first non-trivial React component I built in 2014—not long after I started using React seriously.

I had heard some good things about it and noticed it would allow me to build a blog quite easily. I was eager to learn something new and get something up and running that was more than just my usual WordPress theme. I was on the verge of rebuilding my portfolio site until a certain <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/user/LevelUpTuts\\\">Scott Tolinski</a> released a video on <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2H7fWhQcdE&#x26;feature=youtu.be\\\">GatsbyJS</a>.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"/\\\">GatsbyJS</a> is a static site generator, similar to Jekyll, however it is written using <a href=\\\"https://reactjs.org/\\\">React</a> and allows you to write your pages as React components! It is somewhat similar to create-react-app where almost all the scary Webpack config has been abstracted away from you and everything is setup ready to go, so you can get to the important stuff like…building the site! (If you are a fan of React and not convinced, the <a href=\\\"https://reactjs.org/\\\">React website/docs</a> were just released using Gatsby!)</p>\\n<p>I currently work for a <a href=\\\"http://chromatix.com.au\\\">digital agency</a> where we create custom built <a href=\\\"https://wordpress.org/\\\">WordPress</a> sites from scratch. I have been working here for almost 2 years and have only got to use React a few times, and never with WordPress unfortunately. The Gatsby project caught my eye because I wanted to create a site that was modern, fast, had blog capabilities, and gave me the opportunity to learn some more React and JavaScript. Another reason I ended up going with Gatsby was the promise that your project could be connected to various APIs or even a CMS of your choice.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"the-magic-of-graphql-and-gatsby-plugins\\\"><a href=\\\"#the-magic-of-graphql-and-gatsby-plugins\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>The magic of GraphQL and Gatsby Plugins</h2>\\n<p>Originally, following Scott’s and the official Gatsby tutorial, I had it pulling my content from good ol’ Markdown files. Then I saw it… too good to be true, the mention of connecting it to WordPress… I have been writing WordPress themes for almost 2 years now, so naturally this got me super excited. To have my back-end as WordPress (including <a href=\\\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/\\\">ACF</a>) and the front-end in React… I had found the perfect place to test my front-end abilities.</p>\\n<p>I was skeptical at first: would I have to parse large amounts of JSON to get the data I needed? I have never even interacted with the WordPress REST API, how will I query it?</p>\\n<p>The answer… <a href=\\\"http://graphql.org/\\\">GraphQL</a>. Gatsby ships with it and through an npm install of a <a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/plugins/\\\">gatsby-source plugin</a> of your choice and a tiny bit of a config, you can start querying in no time. I was amazed with how simple queries are using GraphQL. You look at them and you go “Huh, that’s it? Really?“. Gatsby even ships with an in-browser query tester so you can see exactly what data you are getting from your GraphQL queries. Wanna sort those blog posts by date? No problem, just add a flag.</p>\\n<p>With very little configuration and the installation of a single plugin on my WordPress site, I began creating pages and pulling data from them using a simple GraphQL schema. Here is an example of my Projects page which includes pulling some ACF fields which were originally defined in my Projects page template:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Pull the project page content from Wordpress</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> projectsPageQuery <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> graphql<span class=\\\"token template-string\\\"><span class=\\\"token string\\\">`\\nquery projectsPageQuery {\\n  wordpressPage(slug: {eq: &quot;projects&quot;}) {\\n    id\\n    title\\n    content\\n    childWordpressAcfField {\\n      internal {\\n        content\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n`</span></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Pulling blog posts was even easier! If you’d like to sort them by date, ID, title etc. you just add a simple flag to the query like so:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Sort WordPress posts by date</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> postQuery <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> graphql<span class=\\\"token template-string\\\"><span class=\\\"token string\\\">`\\n  query getPostQuery {\\n    allWordpressPost(sort: { fields: [date] }) {\\n      edges {\\n        node {\\n          id\\n          title\\n          excerpt\\n          slug\\n          date\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n`</span></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"wrap-up-and-future\\\"><a href=\\\"#wrap-up-and-future\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Wrap up and future</h2>\\n<p>In just a few weekends I managed to rebuild my portfolio site with the blog I wanted. I’d highly recommend <a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/\\\">Gatsby</a> for anyone who has started getting acquainted with React. Before I started this project I didn’t know a lot about: * Static site generation/JAMstack * Creating a Progressive Web App (PWA) and what qualifies as one * React Router * GraphQL * WordPress REST API</p>\\n<p>Moving forward with Gatsby, I’d like to extend my site to include pagination within the blog, use <a href=\\\"https://www.styled-components.com/\\\">Styled Components</a> and ensure the site scores a 90+ overall on <a href=\\\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/\\\">Lighthouse</a>, Google’s performance auditing tool.</p>\\n<p>Another goal is for my team to start using it with client sites, as the sheer performance out of the box is amazing. My original WordPress (PHP based theme) was scoring around 70 for Performance, however without any optimizations, my Gatsby based site scored 94. Later it scored 99 with some minor optimizations. We have recently had many clients ask for highly performant websites and Progressive Web App’s. Gatsby will be perfect to bridge the gaps between WordPress and React and allow my team to achieve these goals with ease.</p>\",\"excerpt\":\"This article was originally published on  my portfolio site  on October 1, 2017.

After using Wintersmith and Next.js we recently made the switch to Gatsby for our company site. A decision we don’t regret. Here’s why.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"back-in-the-days\\\"><a href=\\\"#back-in-the-days\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Back in the Days..</h2>\\n<p>As mentioned we already built our company website using static site generators early on. Last year, we finally made the switch from our good old custom PHP application with little to no logic, which served us for about two years, to <a href=\\\"http://wintersmith.io/\\\">Wintersmith</a>. At that time this was one of the leading static site generators based on Node.js. Since most of our applications at that time were already JavaScript based it seemed to be the perfect fit. The fact that our company was undergoing a complete rebranding in terms of our corporate identity came in quite handy as well.</p>\\n<p>After running Wintersmith for almost a year we encountered its limits. Some of the major drawbacks at that time were:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>No code splitting, resulting in the client having to load a bunch of unnecessary JavaScript and CSS files</li>\\n<li>Pulling in external resources, such as blog posts, was quite unhandy and sometimes even impossible</li>\\n<li>Build process optimization was almost impossible and in our case resulted in a Webpack setup on top of Wintersmith which was not really maintainable</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"react-to-the-rescue\\\"><a href=\\\"#react-to-the-rescue\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>React to the Rescue!</h2>\\n<p>Since by the time we encountered the problems described above we already had deep knowledge of React we started looking for an alternative based on that hot new thing.</p>\\n<p>The first thing that caught our attention was <a href=\\\"https://github.com/zeit/next.js/\\\">Next.js</a>, as seemingly everyone going for a server-side rendered React app was using it. After some days hacking on our app we encountered some issues, especially when it came to frontend rendering. We chose <a href=\\\"https://prismic.io/\\\">prismic.io</a> for our backend system which served all the content. Although this felt right at first but, as all of us are developers, working around the constraints of it just didn’t feel right.</p>\\n<p>Luckily at that time Gatsby version 1.0 <a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/gatsby-v1/\\\">just got released</a> and we decided to give it a try during one of our so-called Hackdays. We instantly fell in love with the simplicity of the system. Our first approach was to just use all the components which we already had created for Next.js and backed it by simple JSON files containing the content we wanted to serve using the amazing yet simple GraphQL-based pull-in mechanism Gatsby provides. This was accomplished by using the <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-transformer-json\\\">gatsby-transformer-json plugin</a> internally. Keep in mind that our content rarely changes, so this was always the way we wanted it to be (without knowing for some time as we had to admit to ourselves).</p>\\n<p>One of our main goals all along was to show <a href=\\\"https://blog.smartive.ch\\\">our latest blog posts</a> on Medium. Unfortunately at that time there was no plugin to achieve this so we decided to write one ourselves. By the time of writing I’m proud to say we successfully did so and even <a href=\\\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/1907\\\">contributed it back to the community</a>. Make sure to check it out if you’re interested in a similar solution.</p>\\n<p>The only thing left was to actually rebuild and deploy our site once a new blog post gets released on Medium. We chose <a href=\\\"https://ifttt.com/\\\">IFTTT</a> for this task, mainly because of its simplicity. Every time IFTTT picks up a newly published blog post it triggers a GitLab CI pipeline using a webhook, which then rebuilds and deploys our application onto our Docker Cloud infrastructure.</p>\\n<p>The result of our work using Gatsby is an outstanding <a href=\\\"https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https://smartive.ch&#x26;tab=desktop\\\">Google PageSpeed score</a> thanks to the built-in code splitting and cache handling mechanisms.

In part 1 I did the more simple task of migrating an existing React site to Gatsby. This time I migrated my blog, which was a lot more involved and required a lot more Gatsby-specific knowledge.</p>\\n<p>Here’s the gist of what I’m going to cover:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Preparing an existing blog for migration</li>\\n<li>Configuring Gatsby to handle markdown</li>\\n<li>Querying your markdown files using GraphQL</li>\\n<li>Adding custom data to the generated GraphQL schema</li>\\n<li>Turning all your markdown files into static pages</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Let’s jump in.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<h2 id=\\\"preparing-your-existing-blog-for-migration\\\"><a href=\\\"#preparing-your-existing-blog-for-migration\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Preparing your existing blog for migration</h2>\\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you <em>don’t</em> already have a blog or want to create one from scratch there’s a <a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2017-07-19-creating-a-blog-with-gatsby/\\\">tutorial for exactly that right here</a>.</p>\\n<p>Let’s move some files around. Gatsby gives you a good amount of flexibility when it comes to file structure, but for consistency with the docs I’m going to use the suggested file structure for migrating my blog. How you handle this step will depend on what you’re migrating from. I am migrating form Hexo, which is very similar to Jekyll in how it structures files.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"clean-up-your-source-repo\\\"><a href=\\\"#clean-up-your-source-repo\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Clean up your source repo</h3>\\n<p>For the first step, clear everything other than your actual post content out of the repo. For me, this meant everything that wasn’t under the <code>source/</code> directory (that’s a Hexo convention). One way to do this is to take everything not relevant to the upcoming Gatsby blog and move it into its own directory that doesn’t interfere with anything. I chose to create <code>hexo.bak/</code> where all my old blog files would live (except for the content).</p>\\n<p>You could also simply delete everything other than your raw content. It’s up to you.

You can pull in data from anywhere to be rendered in your blog, but for our use case the only data source will be the file system (aka the markdown files stored on your hard drive).</p>\\n<p>But first, let’s check out <a href=\\\"https://github.com/graphql/graphiql\\\">GraphiQL</a>. It’s an excellent playground for testing out GraphQL queries in any GraphQL project. Gatsby ships with it enabled by default, thank goodness. GraphQL can actually be oddly opaque without this excellent tool.</p>\\n<p>Visit <a href=\\\"http://localhost:8000/___graphql\\\">http://localhost:8000/___graphql</a> in the browser and you’ll be greeted with this lovely dev tool:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202017-08-26%20at%201.31.08%20PM.png\\\" alt=\\\"Gatsby Graphiql\\\"></p>\\n<p>I recommend getting to know this tool if you’re not already familiar. You will be coming back to this often to find the right query to pull data for your pages.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"querying-the-file-system\\\"><a href=\\\"#querying-the-file-system\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Querying the file system</h3>\\n<p>If you play around with GraphiQL you’ll notice there’s not that much there. Let’s fix that. We need to teach Gatsby how to query the file system. Luckily this is so common it’s been done for you. Install the file system source plugin:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>yarn add gatsby-source-filesystem</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Now modify <code>gatsby-config.js</code> to both use the plugin and tell it what directory to source files from. Add this to the <code>plugins</code> array:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  resolve<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&apos;gatsby-source-filesystem&apos;</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  options<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    name<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&apos;posts&apos;</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Name this source</span>\\n    path<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> path<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">resolve</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">&apos;./content/_posts&apos;</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Tell it where to find the files</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>As you can see on my system I keep all my markdown files under <code>content/_posts/</code> which is reflected in the <code>path</code> option for the plugin.</p>\\n<p>Now restart the dev server and open GraphiQL up again. You should have access to the <code>allFile</code> root type. Try running this query:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-graphql\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">query</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  allFile <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    edges <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      node <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n        ext\\n        name\\n      <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This will list all the files in the directory you specified to the plugin. You can query all sorts of information about the files. Just investigate the fields available to you under <code>node</code> in GraphQL.</p>\\n<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Hit <kbd></kbd>ctrl<kbd></kbd>space to trigger autocomplete and bring up the list of all available fields.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"handling-markdown\\\"><a href=\\\"#handling-markdown\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Handling Markdown</h3>\\n<p>Being able to query files is a big win, and if you have a directory of HTML files this is all you will need. But if you want to render markdown files as HTML you will need another plugin. Let’s add that now:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>yarn add gatsby-transformer-remark</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>As before, add it to the <code>plugins</code> field in <code>gatsby-config.js</code>:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  resolve<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&apos;gatsby-transformer-remark&apos;</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  options<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    plugins<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This particular plugin can also take <em>its own</em> plugins via the <code>plugins</code> option. I’ve left it empty but this is where you can add things like syntax highlighting or auto-linking of headers. Here’s the current list: <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=gatsby-remark\\\">https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=gatsby-remark</a></p>\\n<p>Save and restart your dev server, then go into GraphiQL and try out the new <code>allMarkdownRemark</code> field:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-graphql\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">query</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  allMarkdownRemark <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    edges <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      node <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n        html\\n      <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This query gives you the full HTML for all your markdown files. If you are using frontmatter you can also access that here. I’m assuming you have a <code>title</code> field in your frontmatter:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>query {\\n  allMarkdownRemark {\\n    edges {\\n      node {\\n        frontmatter {\\n          title\\n        }\\n        html\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Now you have access to the full HTML of your posts as well as the titles. With this we have enough information to render a list of posts on the front page.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"getting-graphql-data-into-your-components\\\"><a href=\\\"#getting-graphql-data-into-your-components\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Getting GraphQL data into your components</h3>\\n<p>Gatsby has the concept of the <code>pageQuery</code>.

</div>\\n<p>This is a simplified example, but there are a few things going on that might not be intuitive.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>In the render method we first check for errors, and return early if any are found</li>\\n<li>If no error are found we render a link for each item in the array: <code>this.props.data.allMarkdownRemark.edges</code></li>\\n<li>We export a <code>pageQuery</code> variable that is constructed using the magic <code>graphql</code> global</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The error handling is pretty straightforward, if a bit verbose, as long as you know what graphql responses look like. In case you didn’t know, if you get an error in a graphql query the response will contain the <code>errors</code> array. We check for this array and handle it accordingly.</p>\\n<p>Now let’s looks specifically at where we render a link for each blog post:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-jsx\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>data<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>allMarkdownRemark<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>edges<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">map</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> node <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> i<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">key</span><span class=\\\"token script language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>i<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&gt;</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>node<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>frontmatter<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>title<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&gt;</span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Notice that the data shape is exactly what we specified in the GraphQL query. This may seem like a lot of nesting just to get at an array of data, but GraphQL emphasizes <em>clarity</em> over conciseness. You’ll notice that if you run your GraphQL query in GraphiQL the data will have the exact shape described above.</p>\\n<p>And that brings us finally to the page query:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> pageQuery <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> graphql<span class=\\\"token template-string\\\"><span class=\\\"token string\\\">`\\n  query {\\n    allMarkdownRemark {\\n      edges {\\n        node {\\n          frontmatter { title }\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n`</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This is how you get data from Gatsby into your react components. Make sure you don’t misspell <code>pageQuery</code> otherwise you won’t get what you want.</p>\\n<p>Also note that <code>graphql</code> is just some magic global variable. Your linter will probably complain about it being undefined and you will just have to ignore it. Personally I think it would be more clear if <code>graphql</code> was imported from Gatsby, but the project is still young so the API could change at some point ¯\\\\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"linking-to-blog-posts\\\"><a href=\\\"#linking-to-blog-posts\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Linking to blog posts</h3>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>But the links don’t link anywhere… where’s that <code>href</code>?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Let’s remedy that.

Notice that spaces turn into hyphens and special characters are removed. This is simple enough to do in JavaScript, but it felt wrong to do it on the fly when rendering components. This is <em>data</em> so I wanted to be able to query it through GraphQL.</p>\\n<p>Enter <code>setFieldsOnGraphQLNodeType</code>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Aside:</strong> Gatsby is super extensible. It’s the primary reason I switched from Hexo which worked well enough for my use case.</p>\\n<p>In order to extend this particular part of Gatsby you need to create a <code>gatsby-node.js</code> file. This file let’s you work with all of Gatsby’s plugin hooks that are run in node. The GraphQL server is run in node, so this is where we add custom fields. Example:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// gatsby-node.js</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> GraphQLString <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">require</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">&apos;graphql&apos;</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> <span class=\\\"token function-variable function\\\">getURL</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>node<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">/* See the source link below for implementation */</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\nexports<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function-variable function\\\">setFieldsOnGraphQLNodeType</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> type <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">if</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>type<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>name <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">!==</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&apos;MarkdownRemark&apos;</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> Promise<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">resolve</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    url<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      type<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> GraphQLString<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n      resolve<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> node <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">getURL</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>node<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Source code for <a href=\\\"https://github.com/iansinnott/iansinnott.github.io/blob/source/gatsby-node.js\\\">gatsby-node.js here</a>.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>If you’ve worked with GraphQL before this should look very familiar. In fact, as you can see the string type is imported directly from GraphQL and not from Gatsby.</p>\\n<p>Basically you check the type of node and if it’s a type your interested in you resolve with some fields. Fields in GraphQL require a <code>type</code> and a way to <code>resolve</code> the value.</p>\\n<p>I’ve omitted the implementation of <code>getURL</code> here, but you can see the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/iansinnott/iansinnott.github.io/blob/gatsby-migration/gatsby-node.js#L17\\\">source code here</a> (NOTE: in the source it’s called <code>getSlug</code> instead of <code>getURL</code>).</p>\\n<p>You can use this technique to add any field you want to your GraphQL schema. Now you should be all set to render <code>Link</code> components that actually point somewhere interesting </p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"generating-pages-from-markdown-files\\\"><a href=\\\"#generating-pages-from-markdown-files\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Generating pages from markdown files</h2>\\n<p>This is where it all comes together. If you finished the last section you would have ended up with a bunch of links that point to the correct URL but when you tried visiting the URL there was nothing there This is because Gatsby hasn’t yet generated an additional pages. It’s still just rendering whatever is in your <code>src/pages/</code> directory.</p>\\n<p>By default, Gatsby will create a static HTML page for everything under <code>src/pages/</code>. At this point we’ve discussed <code>src/pages/index.js</code> extensively. It will be the <code>index.html</code> page of your site, and thus your landing page.</p>\\n<p>For any stand-alone pages, simply create a corresponding js file in the <code>pages/</code> directory and you are good to go. For example, <code>src/pages/about.js</code> would generate an <code>about.html</code> page. Simple.</p>\\n<p>But almost everyone will want to generate some pages based on data, not on the files in the pages directory. Gatsby let’s us do this.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"generating-custom-pages\\\"><a href=\\\"#generating-custom-pages\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Generating custom pages</h3>\\n<p>The key here is again to hook in to one of Gatsby’s many plugin hooks. In this case, <code>createPages</code>. In the same <code>gatsby-node.js</code> file as before:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// gatsby-node.js</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// .. other stuff from before...</span>\\n\\nexports<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function-variable function\\\">createPages</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> boundActionCreators <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> createPage <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> boundActionCreators<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> postTemplate <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> path<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">resolve</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">&apos;./src/templates/custom-page.js&apos;</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Create a custom page!</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\">createPage</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    path<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token template-string\\\"><span class=\\\"token string\\\">`/my-custom-page/`</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    component<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> postTemplate<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    context<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span> <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Context will be passed in to the page query as graphql variables</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>At the most basic level this method of page creation is quite simple: Grab the <code>createPage</code> function from the API and call it with some props.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>path</code> is required. This is the path that your page will have as a generated HTML file. It’s the URL of your final page.</li>\\n<li><code>component</code> is also required. It’s the file containing the react component that will be used to render this particular page.</li>\\n<li><code>context</code> is optional but I’ve included it here because it will be important soon. This lets you pass data down to the react component specified in the <code>component</code> option as well as the <code>pageQuery</code> (if any).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The API is actually pretty simple: To generate a new page call <code>createPage</code> with some props. So in pseudo code:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Get all markdown files</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Call create page for each one</span>\\nmarkdownFiles<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">forEach</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>post <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\">createPage</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    path<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> post<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>url<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    component<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&apos;./src/templates/post.js&apos;</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    context<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n      id<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> post<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>id<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>I’ve included the pseudo code to highlight the fact that nothing too magical is going on here. We just need to call create page for every post we want to create. The implementation is a bit more verbose, but that’s still all it’s doing.</p>\\n<p>So in order to make this work we also need to be able to query GraphQL just like we do in the page query. Gatsby let’s us do exactly that by giving us access to the <code>graphql</code> object and letting us return a promise so that we can do async work.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span>br <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&gt;</span><span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// NOTE: I&apos;m using async/await to simplify the code since it&apos;s now natively supported</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// in Node 8.x.

So as long as you don’t mind reading a bit of source code to figure out how something works there’s no limit to what you can implement.</p>\\n<p>Here are some ideas:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Add previous and next buttons to each post</li>\\n<li>Create a remark plugin to add custom block types</li>\\n<li>Aggregate tags from your frontmatter and generate pages for all posts of a specific tag</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Some of these—such as pagination—are implemented on my blog.

It’s a best-in-class static site generator and well worth the adoption time if you want to customize your blog.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<p>If anything was unclear or you have more questions feel free to ask me on <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/ian_sinn\\\">Twitter</a>.</p>\",\"excerpt\":\"This article was originally posted on  my blog (original link) .

So I started digging into how Gatsby 1.x works—particular the <a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-four/#data-in-gatsby\\\">data layer</a>.</p>\\n<p>Things really clicked when I read this part about the GraphiQL IDE and watched how to drill down on the data.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/54896a75a1448107a7ba69f27ae246da.gif\\\" alt=\\\"GraphiQL\\\"></p>\\n<p>Prior to reading / seeing that part in the documentation, looking at the code I could understand roughly what was going on but it didn’t feel familiar. Like anything new, there’s that “I don’t know what I’m doing” stage. I know what I want to do, but I don’t understand the syntax enough to make it happen. Seeing the docs and how you can explore the schema in GraphiQL (autocomplete is </p>\\n<p><strong>From the docs:</strong></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>You first sketch out the data query by playing in GraphiQL, then copy this to a React page component to start building the UI.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>“Sketch &#x26; Copy” using the GraphiQL was a revelation.

It’s a nice starter push into GraphQL and many other advanced features the websites of the future will need to be performant.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes we don’t do things because they are unfamiliar to us. Sometimes we need a little push. Thanks for the push GatsbyJS. The learning curve may seem daunting but the payoff is huge.

It helped me quickly move a project of mine from idea to production by creating a landing page very fast.</p>\\n<p>Static site generators like Jekyll all work pretty similarly:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Describe your content in some common templating language (<a href=\\\"pugjs.org\\\">Pug</a>, <a href=\\\"http://handlebarsjs.com\\\">Handlebars</a>, etc)</li>\\n<li>While in development, start a local web server and add file “watchers” that will listen for content changes and re-render the site</li>\\n<li>Finally, render the whole site in static HTML and deploy. The generator will combine your files and produce a well formed HTML content.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Let’s say you navigate to the good old site example.com:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The browser requests the page at example.com</li>\\n<li>The server responds with the HTML content</li>\\n<li>The browser renders the page and loads the asset related to the script tag</li>\\n<li>JS will instruct the browser to manipulate the DOM, for example, to show a “welcome to this page” popup dialog.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>A caveat here is that you have to keep the client side logic separated from the backend. The client side JS file that shows the modal dialog has nothing to do with the PUG file you wrote and eventually became HTML. The client side logic only manipulates directly the DOM.</p>\\n<p>This architecture is fairly similar to a Wordpress site. A Wordpress engine also generates the HTML and serve it to the browser, after which the client side JS you wrote kicks in and starts manipulating the DOM. Wordpress’s responses can be cached, of course, and served to the client; that setup effectively makes it another static site generator with a GUI text editor.</p>\\n<p>So to recap, the nice part of the static site setup is that your website is just static assets that are sitting somewhere ready to be served to user requests. No need to maintain a runtime, a database, application code, or complex optimized web servers.</p>\\n<p>But the downside is you have to keep separate template files that will eventually rendered as HTML on the browser, and Javascript file that will eventually manipulate that HTML again on the browser (and CSS assets too).</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"enter-the-new-world-order\\\"><a href=\\\"#enter-the-new-world-order\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Enter the new world order</h2>\\n<p>I <a href=\\\"https://kostasbariotis.com/hands-on-react-js/\\\">started experimenting</a> with React two years ago. It came with so many features out of the box that no one ever has seen except the guys working internally on Facebook’s codebase. But the thing that stood out immediately was the way which React was handling the DOM, aka the Virtual DOM.</p>\\n<p>To change a page’s display, you have to change the DOM — but changing the DOM is computationally expensive, so — slow. React is smart, and analyzes the changes you want to make so it applies only required changes, thus making the rendering much faster.</p>\\n<p>If you use React with <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-dom-server.html\\\">server-side rendering</a>, your flow looks something like this:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A browser requests a page</li>\\n<li>The server responds with static HTML</li>\\n<li>The browser immediately renders the page so the user can see it</li>\\n<li>The browser loads additional JS in the background</li>\\n<li>The client takes some action, like navigating to a different route.</li>\\n<li>The browser uses the additional JS to handle this action.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>On your end, the development flow looks:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Describe your content in React.js Components</li>\\n<li>During development, write code like a boss (hot reloading, modularized code, webpack plugins, etc…)</li>\\n<li>Use React.js Server Side Rendering API to convert this code to static HTML content, and Javascript code, on your server</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>It’s really that easy? Well, sort of.</p>\\n<p>There is the need for a strong abstraction that will… * track your links across your components * parse content written in another format, like blog posts written in Markdown * generate code that will not bloat the client and will efficiently serve the content to the user.</p>\\n<p>Thankfully, there are a few projects that took the initiative on this: <a href=\\\"/\\\">Gatsby.js</a>, <a href=\\\"https://phenomic.io\\\">Phenomic</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://nextein.now.sh\\\">nextein</a>.</p>\\n<p>At the time that I started following them, early 2017, all of them were in a very early stage and none of them could generate my site’s content the way I wanted.</p>\\n<p>I wanted to make the generated site, exactly like the old one, in terms of both user experience and keeping my old routes and paths so I don’t have weird 404s.</p>\\n<p>Gatsby came with client side routing out of the box and an extensive API that you can use to generate your content exactly like you need. And once Gatsby.js hit major version 1, I started using it and the result…you can <a href=\\\"https://kostasbariotis.com/\\\">look at it</a>!</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"what-exactly-am-i-looking-at\\\"><a href=\\\"#what-exactly-am-i-looking-at\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>What exactly am I looking at?</h2>\\n<p>First, if you navigate around my blog (or around this site!), you will notice that the browser doesn’t fully re-render the site. Gatsby will generate a JSON file for each route, so the browser can request only that file and React.js will render only the appropriate components.</p>\\n<p>(Previously to do this required a lot of customization — I was using a technique called <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com__ghost-theme/blob/master/src/js/app.js#L11\\\">pjax</a> to create the same effect. While it looked the same, it was more hack-ish; Gatsby provides this out of the box)</p>\\n<p>Second, you can take a look at the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com\\\">source code</a>. Let me give you a sense of how this site is being generated. You can find all my blog posts and the main pages(<code>/</code>, <code>/about</code>, <code>/drafts</code>) of this site at <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/pages\\\"><code>/src/pages</code></a>. Common components can be found at <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/components\\\"><code>/src/components</code></a>. At <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/gatsby-node.js\\\"><code>/gatsby-node.js</code></a> you can find the route it takes in order to render the site. First, it loads all posts using the GraphQL api which queries all <code>.md</code> files. Then it creates a page for each one, using the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/templates/blog-post.js\\\"><code>/src/templates/blog-post.js</code></a> template and before that it creates a page, with pagination, for all posts and tags again using the appropriate template file.</p>\\n<p>During development, Gatsby will generate all of these in memory and fire up a development server that I can use to preview my site.</p>\\n<p>You can try it yourself by cloning the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com\\\">source code</a> and after installing dependencies, run:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>npm run develop</code> to fire up the development server</li>\\n<li><code>npm run build</code> to build the site (check the <code>/public</code> folder after it’s done)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"an-alternative-to-html-caching\\\"><a href=\\\"#an-alternative-to-html-caching\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>An alternative to HTML caching</h2>\\n<p>Now let’s bring these threads together. Let’s say you have a Wordpress site. You’re caching the content, which is nice for performance, but you’re building on it now and want to move to a more modern web development experience.</p>\\n<p>One path is the one I took — for the last three years, I was using a similar system called <a href=\\\"https://ghost.org\\\">Ghost</a>. While it served me well, I really got tired of updating it, ssh-ing to the server, doing migrations and doing other ops required by such a stack. (There are paid hosting options, of course, but that comes with a different set of problems). So I switched to Gatsby.</p>\\n<p>Another option, if you want to keep Wordpress’ Admin UI is to maintain your content, is to separate the backend from the frontend.</p>\\n<p>Imagine that instead of having <a href=\\\"https://memcached.org/\\\">memcached</a> caching your HTML in front of your WordPress site, you trigger a hook each time your database changes that will re-generate the frontend using Gatsby’s <a href=\\\"/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/\\\">Wordpress plugin</a>. Yes, Gatsby supports multiple backend sources to load your content. Instead of storing them inside your version control like me, you can just as well load them from your Wordpress’s MySQL database.</p>\\n<p>To conclude, Gatsby will allow us to:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>serve static content without maintaining complex stacks</li>\\n<li>keep a clear separation between content and the presentation layer</li>\\n<li>have cool features like client side routing and hot reload on development, out of the box</li>\\n<li>reuse the same code that is being used to generate the backend content at our visitors’ browsers</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I hope you will experiment with Gatsby, and let me know what you think!</p>\",\"excerpt\":\"In this post, I will talk about static site generators — how they have evolved and why I switched from a  Ghost  powered site to

It does this by rendering dynamic React components into static HTML content via <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-dom-server.html\\\">server side rendering</a> at build time. This means that your users get all the benefits of a static site such as the ability to work without JavaScript, search engine friendliness, speedy load times, etc. without losing the dynamism and interactivity that is expected of the modern web. Once rendered to static HTML, client-site React/JavaScript <em>can</em> take over (if creating stateful components or logic in <code>componentDidMount</code>) and add dynamism to the statically generated content.</p>\\n<p>Gatsby <a href=\\\"/blog/gatsby-v1/\\\">recently released</a> a v1.0.0 with a bunch of new features, including (but not limited to) the ability to create content queries with GraphQL, integration with various CMSs—including WordPress, Contentful, Drupal, etc., and route based code splitting to keep the end-user experience as snappy as possible.

For instance, a typical workflow often involves using <a href=\\\"/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/\\\"><code>gatsby-source-filesystem</code></a>, which loads files off of disk—e.g. Markdown files—and then specifying a Markdown transformer to transform the Markdown into HTML.</p>\\n<p>Since the bulk of the blog’s content, and each article, will be authored in Markdown, let’s add that <a href=\\\"/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/\\\"><code>gatsby-source-filesystem</code></a> plugin.

Let’s do just that, and create the folder <code>src/pages/07-12-2017-getting-started</code>, and place an <code>index.md</code> inside!</p>\\n<p>The content of this Markdown file will be our blog post, authored in Markdown (of course!).

What is that? That is what is referred to as <a href=\\\"https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/\\\"><code>frontmatter</code></a>, and the contents of the block can be used to inject React components with the specified data, e.g. path, date, title, etc. Any piece of data can be injected here (e.g. tags, sub-title,draft, etc.), so feel free to experiment and find what necessary pieces of frontmatter are required to achieve an ideal blogging system for your usage. One important note is that <code>path</code> will be used when we dynamically create our pages to specify the URL/path to render the file (in a later step!). In this instance, <code>http://localhost:8000/hello-world</code> will be the path to this file.</p>\\n<p>Now that we have created a blog post with frontmatter and some content, we can begin actually writing some React components that will display this data!</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"creating-the-react-template\\\"><a href=\\\"#creating-the-react-template\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Creating the (React) template</h2>\\n<p>As Gatsby supports server side rendering (to string) of React components, we can write our template in… you guessed it, React!

This path will be available as <code>$path</code> in our query. For instance, if we were viewing our previously created blog post, the path of the file that data will be pulled from will be <code>/hello-world</code>.</p>\\n<p><code>markdownRemark</code> will be the injected property available via the prop <code>data</code>, as named in the GraphQL query. Each property we pull via the GraphQL query will be available under this <code>markdownRemark</code> property. For example, to access the transformed HTML we would access the <code>data</code> prop via <code>data.markdownRemark.html</code>.</p>\\n<p><code>frontmatter</code>, is of course our data structure we provided at the beginning of our Markdown file. Each key we define there will be available to be injected into the query.</p>\\n<p>At this point, we have a bunch of plugins installed to load files off of disk, transform Markdown to HTML, and other utilities. We have a single, lonely Markdown file that will be rendered as a blog post. Finally, we have a React template for blog posts, as well as a wired up GraphQL query to query for a blog post and inject the React template with the queried data. Next up: programmatically creating the necessary static pages (and injecting the templates) with Gatsby’s Node API. Let’s get down to it.</p>\\n<p>An important note to make at this point is that the GraphQL query takes place at <strong>build</strong> time. The component is injected with the <code>data</code> prop that is seeded by the GraphQL query. Unless anything dynamic (e.g. logic in <code>componentDidMount</code>, state changes, etc.) occurs, this component will be pure, rendered HTML generated via the React rendering engine, GraphQL, and Gatsby!</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"creating-the-static-pages\\\"><a href=\\\"#creating-the-static-pages\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Creating the static pages</h2>\\n<p>Gatsby exposes a powerful Node API, which allows for functionality such as creating dynamic pages (blog posts!), extending the babel or webpack configs, modifying the created nodes or pages, etc. This API is exposed in the <code>gatsby-node.js</code> file in the root directory of your project—e.g. at the same level as <code>gatsby-config.js</code>. Each export found in this file will be parsed by Gatsby, as detailed in its <a href=\\\"/docs/node-apis/\\\">Node API specification</a>.

Finally, we’re using the <code>createPage</code> action creator/function made available in boundActionCreators. Gatsby uses Redux internally to manage its state, and <code>boundActionCreators</code> are simply the exposed action creators of Gatsby, of which <code>createPage</code> is one of the action creators! For the full list of exposed action creators, check out <a href=\\\"/docs/bound-action-creators/\\\">Gatsby’s documentation</a>.

The actual posts are available via the path <code>result.data.allMarkdownRemark.edges</code>. Each edge contains an internal node, and this node holds the useful data that we will use to construct a page with Gatsby. Our GraphQL “shape” is directly reflected in this data object, so each property we pulled from that query will be available when we are querying in our GraphQL blog post template.</p>\\n<p>The <code>createPage</code> API accepts an object which requires <code>path</code> and <code>component</code> properties to be defined, which we have done above. Additionally, an optional property <code>context</code> can be used to inject data and make it available to the blog post template component via injected props (log out props to see each available prop!). Each time we build with Gatsby, <code>createPage</code> will be called, and Gatsby will create a static HTML file of the path we specified in the post’s frontmatter—the result of which will be our stringified and parsed React template injected with the data from our GraphQL query. Whoa, it’s actually starting to come together!</p>\\n<p>We can run <code>yarn develop</code> at this point, and then navigate to <code>http://localhost:8000/hello-world</code> to see our first blog post, which should look something like below:</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/my-first-blog-post-deb7f0d56ec7013985a6053e9c88601d-80eb1.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 786px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 67.28395061728395%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAANCAYAAACpUE5eAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAABAUlEQVQ4y2PYvHmzyNnj25suX77cdOzYsaZz5841Xbt2Dcy/evUq0fjMmTNNe/fuVWBoKuk32Lbo5P9tC0/837Lg+P+dS8/837P83P89K86ThHcsPvV/SstiDwY3+SzDdL3Z/zON5vzvjN34vzth038QnxwcoFLpyTCla67hjZNP/187/vj/mX03/5/ac+P/qd3X/58G0iD++QN3/oPkicEr523xZFi3bp3hfyD49evX/1u3bv2/ffv2/3v37v0Hhsv/u3fvgsWIBSdOnEAY+Pfv3/8fP36E43fv3oHFSAEoBlIDjBo4WA3MyMgQmzt3bvHMmTPLKMFz5swpqampUQAAyRlw3+gP5fsAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px #ffffff;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"My first blog post with Gatsby\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/my-first-blog-post-deb7f0d56ec7013985a6053e9c88601d-c4266.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/my-first-blog-post-deb7f0d56ec7013985a6053e9c88601d-4fd5b.png 197w,\\n/static/my-first-blog-post-deb7f0d56ec7013985a6053e9c88601d-4fc86.png 393w,\\n/static/my-first-blog-post-deb7f0d56ec7013985a6053e9c88601d-c4266.png 786w,\\n/static/my-first-blog-post-deb7f0d56ec7013985a6053e9c88601d-22348.png 1179w,\\n/static/my-first-blog-post-deb7f0d56ec7013985a6053e9c88601d-f35d4.png 1572w,\\n/static/my-first-blog-post-deb7f0d56ec7013985a6053e9c88601d-1ea43.png 2358w,\\n/static/my-first-blog-post-deb7f0d56ec7013985a6053e9c88601d-80eb1.png 2592w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>At this point, we’ve created a single static blog post as an HTML file, which was created by a React component and several GraphQL queries. However, this isn’t a blog! We can’t expect our users to guess the path of each post, we need to have an index or listing page, where we display each blog post, a short snippet, and a link to the full blog post. Wouldn’t you know it, we can do this incredibly easily with Gatsby, using a similar strategy as we used in our blog template, e.g. a React component and a GraphQL query.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"creating-the-blog-listing\\\"><a href=\\\"#creating-the-blog-listing\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Creating the Blog Listing</h2>\\n<p>I won’t go into quite as much detail for this section, because we’ve already done something very similar for our blog template! Look at us, we’re pro Gatsby-ers at this point!</p>\\n<p>Gatsby has a standard for “listing pages,” and they’re placed in the root of our filesystem we specified in <code>gatsby-source-filesystem</code>, e.g. <code>src/pages/index.js</code>. So create that file if it does not exist, and let’s get it working! Additionally note that any static JavaScript files (that export a React component!) will get a corresponding static HTML file. For instance, if we create <code>src/pages/tags.js</code>, the path <code>http://localhost:8000/tags/</code> will be available within the browser and the statically generated site.</p>\\n<div

So we’ve followed a similar approach to our blog post template, so this should hopefully seem pretty familiar. Once more we’re exporting <code>pageQuery</code> which contains a GraphQL query. Note that we’re pulling a slightly different data set, specifically we are pulling an <code>excerpt</code> of 250 characters rather than the full HTML, as well as we are formatting the pulled date with a format string! GraphQL is awesome.</p>\\n<p>The actual React component is fairly trivial, but one important note should be made. It’s important that when linking to internal content, i.e. other blog links, that you should always use <code>gatsby-link</code>. Gatsby does not work if pages are not routed via this utility. Additionally, this utility also works with <code>pathPrefix</code>, which allows for a Gatsby site to be deployed a non-root domain. This is useful if this blog will be hosted on something like Github Pages, or perhaps hosted at <code>/blog</code>.</p>\\n<p>Now this is getting exciting and it feels like we’re finally getting somewhere! At this point, we have a fully functional blog generated by Gatsby, with real content authored in Markdown, a blog listing, and the ability to navigate around in the blog. If you run <code>yarn develop</code>, <code>http://localhost:8000</code> should display a preview of each blog post, and each post title links to the content of the blog post.

A blog is just the starting point; Gatsby’s rich ecosystem, extensible API, and advanced querying capabilities provide a powerful toolset for building truly incredible, performant sites.</p>\\n<p>Now go build something great.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/dream-bigger-1eb72aab7f753fd71411e0b504f13608-14c24.jpeg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 721px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 47.57281553398058%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px #ffffff;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Dream Bigger\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/dream-bigger-1eb72aab7f753fd71411e0b504f13608-14c24.jpeg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/dream-bigger-1eb72aab7f753fd71411e0b504f13608-04be1.jpeg 197w,\\n/static/dream-bigger-1eb72aab7f753fd71411e0b504f13608-71514.jpeg 393w,\\n/static/dream-bigger-1eb72aab7f753fd71411e0b504f13608-14c24.jpeg 721w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"links\\\"><a href=\\\"#links\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Links</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/dschau/gatsby-blog-starter-kit\\\"><code>@dschau/gatsby-blog-starter-kit</code></a> </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A working repo demonstrating all of the aforementioned functionality of Gatsby</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/DSchau/create-gatsby-blog-post\\\"><code>@dschau/create-gatsby-blog-post</code></a> </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A utility and CLI I created to scaffold out a blog post following the predefined Gatsby structure with frontmatter, date, path, etc.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/dschau/blog\\\">Source code for my blog</a> </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The source code for my blog, which takes the gatsby-starter-blog-post (previous link), and expands upon it with a bunch of features and some more advanced functionality</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\",\"excerpt\":\"Gatsby is an incredible static site generator that allows for React to be used as the underlying rendering engine to scaffold out a static…\",\"timeToRead\":18,\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/blog/2017-07-19-creating-a-blog-with-gatsby/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"excerpt\":\"In this post, we'll take a deep dive into Gatsby and some of the new 1.0 features by creating a static blog.

This new system enables rich integrations with CMSs like Contentful, Wordpress, and Drupal along with other remote and local sources.</p>\\n<p>In Gatsby v0, (like pretty much every static site generator) data was processed then <em>pushed</em> into templates to be rendered into HTML. This is a simple pattern and works great for many use cases. But when you start working on more complex sites, you really start to miss the flexibility of a database-driven site. With a database, all your data is available to query against in any fashion you’d like. Whatever bits of data you need to assemble a page, you can <em>pull</em> in. You want to create author pages showing their bio and last 5 posts? It’s just a query away.</p>\\n<p>We wanted this same flexibility for Gatsby. So for 1.0, the Gatsby data team has built a new data processing layer which converts your data (whether from local files or remote sources) into a <em>GraphQL schema</em> which you can query against like a database.</p>\\n<p>Every Gatsby page can have a GraphQL query which tells Gatsby what data is required for that page. The data layer runs the GraphQL queries during development and at build time and writes out a JSON file with the result of the query. This JSON file is then loaded alongside React code and injected into the React component as props.</p>\\n<p>Because we know at build-time what data is needed for every page, we can easily pre-fetch page data meaning even very complex, data-heavy pages load almost instantly.</p>\\n<p>This pattern of <em>colocating</em> your queries next to your views is copied from the <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/relay/\\\">Relay data framework from Facebook</a>.

When a page loads, Gatsby immediately starts prefetching resources for pages nearby so that when a user clicks on a link, the new page loads instantly.</p>\\n<p>Many of the top e-commerce websites in areas where people are coming online for the first time are developing their websites using these techniques.</p>\\n<p>Read Google’s case studies on:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2016/flipkart\\\">Flipkart (India)</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2016/konga\\\">Konga (Nigeria)</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2016/housing\\\">Housing.com (India)</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"service-worker-and-offline-support\\\"><a href=\\\"#service-worker-and-offline-support\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Service worker and offline support</h2>\\n<p>Service workers are perhaps the most exciting technology that’s come to the web in the past several years. It makes possible (finally!) sophisticated client caching plus true offline support. We’ve added excellent support to Gatsby for Service Workers and a great offline experience. If you’re using Chrome or Firefox, this site loads and works offline! <em>Service workers make your site much more resilient against bad networks</em>.

Which means someone loading your frontpage loads far more code than is necessary which is bad then users get frustrated when site isn’t responsive to their clicks and touches while the code loads.</p>\\n<p>Gatsby 1.0 initially only loads the code necessary for the page you’re on. As you navigate around, Gatsby loads in the code needed for each route.</p>\\n<p>This means that one page with heavy imports:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> d3 <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&quot;d3&quot;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> threejs <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&quot;react-threejs&quot;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>…won’t affect the performance of the rest of the site.</p>\\n<p>This is particularly helpful for teams of people collaborating on a site with pages with very different technical and business requirements. Different parts of the site can evolve independently of each other.</p>\\n<p>One client I’m working with on Gatsby 1.0 (a stealth startup in San Francisco) is using Gatsby to build both their marketing site <em>and</em> SaaS app within the <em>same Gatsby codebase</em>.</p>\\n<p>The marketing pages of their site are built using markdown and React components along with a modern css-in-js library <a href=\\\"https://github.com/threepointone/glamor\\\">Glamor</a> for styling. The SaaS portion uses <a href=\\\"http://redux.js.org/\\\">Redux</a> to communicate with their Django API.</p>\\n<p>The marketing portion of the site loads quickly with minimal JavaScript. When a potential customer goes to sign-up for the app, there’s no <em>awkward jump from the marketing website to the web app</em>—just a simple page change which seamlessly loads in the needed JavaScript. The <em>team is sharing components and styles across the site</em> without stepping on each others shoes as they rapidly iterate on features.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"ending-note\\\"><a href=\\\"#ending-note\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Ending note</h2>\\n<p>Gatsby is just getting started.

Gatsby simplifies website development by extracting configuration out of your site and moving it into the framework and community plugins.</p>\\n<p>You give Gatsby React.js components, data, and styles and Gatsby gives you back an optimized website.</p>\\n<p>Gatsbygram is a completely vanilla Gatsby site. Its optimizations are from the framework.</p>\\n<p>Gatsby includes a full modern JavaScript toolchain (Babel/webpack/Uglify) with optimized production builds and an innovative <em>declarative</em> asset pipeline.</p>\\n<p>For Gatsbygram, Gatsby generates over <em>1000</em> image thumbnails for responsive images without <em>any</em> custom scripting by leveraging the Gatsby image processing plugin <a href=\\\"/packages/gatsby-transformer-sharp/\\\">gatsby-transformer-sharp</a>.</p>\\n<p>Stop wasting time and build something!</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"app-structure\\\"><a href=\\\"#app-structure\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>App structure</h2>\\n<p>All static site generators create a set of files that determine the routing in your site. Typically, you define the output file structure (and thus URL structure) of your site by way of the input structure. For example the input structure:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>my-site/\\n  index.md\\n  blogs/\\n    blog1.md</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>…would be transformed to:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>my-site/\\n  index.html\\n  blogs/\\n    blog1.html</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This is fine at first, but can be limiting. For example, in Gatsbygram, we have a JSON data blob scraped from an Instagram user profile. From this we want to generate a page for each image. We couldn’t do this with a typical static site generator, but Gatsby lets you define routes programmatically through the <code>createPages</code> API using any data you have available.</p>\\n<p>Here is how we define pages from our JSON data for Gatsbygram at build time in the site’s <a href=\\\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/examples/gatsbygram/gatsby-node.js\\\"><code>gatsby-node.js</code> file</a>:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> _ <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">require</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token template-string\\\"><span class=\\\"token string\\\">`lodash`</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> Promise <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">require</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token template-string\\\"><span class=\\\"token string\\\">`bluebird`</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> path <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">require</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token template-string\\\"><span class=\\\"token string\\\">`path`</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> slug <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">require</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token template-string\\\"><span class=\\\"token string\\\">`slug`</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> slash <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">require</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token template-string\\\"><span class=\\\"token string\\\">`slash`</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Implement the Gatsby API &#x201C;createPages&#x201D;.

HTML page and then the JavasScript to convert the site into a web application. Which means that clicking around the site doesn’t require a page reload. Gatsby <em>pre-caches</em> code and data needed for other pages so that clicking on a link loads the next page instantly.</p>\\n<p>All the setup for this is handled behind the scenes. Gatsby uses <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router\\\">React Router</a> under the hood but generates all the configuration for you.</p>\\n<p>Normally page resources are pre-cached with a service worker. But as several browsers (Safari/Microsoft Edge) still don’t support Service Workers, the <a href=\\\"/packages/gatsby-link/\\\">Gatsby <code>&#x3C;Link></code> component</a> pre-caches resources for pages it links to by loading them into memory.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"plugins\\\"><a href=\\\"#plugins\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Plugins</h2>\\n<p>Gatsby has always had a rich set of lifecycle APIs to allow you to hook into various events during development, building, and in the client.</p>\\n<p>Gatsby 1.0 adds new APIs and also adds a <a href=\\\"/docs/plugins/\\\">new plugin architecture</a>.

The holy grail of CSS performance is <em>inlined critical CSS</em>. Meaning a) only ship a page with the CSS necessary to render that page and b) inline it in the <code>&#x3C;head></code> instead of putting it in a separate file. There are various tools to make this happen but they tend to involve extensive configuration and heavy post-processing.</p>\\n<p>But with Typography.js and Glamor you get optimized CSS with no tedious, error-prone bookkeeping. Typography.js (by definition) generates only global styles so its styles are included on every page. Glamor includes some <a href=\\\"https://github.com/threepointone/glamor/blob/master/docs/server.md\\\">clever server-rendering optimizations</a> which I’ve implemented in the <a href=\\\"/packages/gatsby-plugin-glamor/\\\">Gatsby Glamor plugin</a> where it automatically extracts out the CSS used <em>in components on the page being server rendered</em> and automatically inlines those styles in the generated HTML page.</p>\\n<p>Super fast CSS by default. </p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"creating-your-own-gatsbygram\\\"><a href=\\\"#creating-your-own-gatsbygram\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Creating your own Gatsbygram</h2>\\n<p>It’s easy to create your own “Gatsbygram” site from an Instagram account.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"instructions-on-setting-up-your-own-gatsbygram-site\\\"><a href=\\\"#instructions-on-setting-up-your-own-gatsbygram-site\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Instructions on setting up your own Gatsbygram site.</h3>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token comment\\\"># Clone the Gatsby repo.</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token function\\\">git</span> clone -b 1.0 git@github.com:gatsbyjs/gatsby.git\\n<span class=\\\"token function\\\">cd</span> gatsby/examples/gatsbygram\\n<span class=\\\"token function\\\">npm</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">install</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\"># Remove the committed scrapped Instagram data</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token function\\\">rm</span> -r data\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\"># Scrape a new account</span>\\nnode scrape.js INSTAGRAM_USERNAME\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\"># Wait for pictures to download...</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\"># Start the Gatsby development server.

你将需要确保你在你的gatsby-config.js中设置了pathPrefix来使其工作（如果你没有路径前缀，就把它设置为/）。</p>\\n<p>在JavaScript代码中，您可以使用<strong>PATH_PREFIX</strong>用于类似的目的：</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre

The most prominent is the &quot;bootstrap&quot; process. It has several subprocesses. One tricky part to their design is that they run both once during the initial bootstrap but also stay alive during development to continue to respond to changes. This is what drives hot reloading that all Gatsby data is &quot;alive&quot; and reacts to changes in the environment.\\n  </p>\\n  \\n  <p>\\n    The bootstrap process is as follows:\\n  </p>\\n  \\n  <p>\\n    load site config -&gt; load plugins -&gt; source nodes -&gt; transform nodes -&gt; create graphql schema -&gt; create pages -&gt; compile component queries -&gt; run queries -&gt; fin\\n  </p>\\n  \\n  <p>\\n    Once the initial bootstrap is finished, for the development server we start <code>webpack-dev-server</code> and a simple express server for serving files and for a production build, we start building the CSS then JavaScript then HTML with webpack.\\n  </p>\\n  \\n  <p>\\n    During these processes there are various extension points where plugins can intervene. All major processes have a <code>onPre</code> and <code>onPost</code> e.g. <code>onPreBootstrap</code> and <code>onPostBootstrap</code> or <code>onPreBuild</code> or <code>onPostBuild</code>. During bootstrap, plugins can respond at various stages to APIs like <code>onCreatePages</code>, <code>onCreateBabelConfig</code>, and <code>onSourceNodes</code>.\\n  </p>\\n  \\n  <p>\\n    At each extension point, Gatsby identifies the plugins which implement the API and calls them in serial following their order in the site&apos;s <code>gatsby-config.js</code>.\\n  </p>\\n  \\n  <p>\\n    In addition to extension APIs in node, plugins can also implement extension APIs in the server rendering process and the browser e.g. <code>onClientEntry</code> or <code>onRouteUpdate</code>\\n  </p>\\n  \\n  <p>\\n    The three main inspirations for this API and spec are React.js&apos; API specifically <a href=\\\"https://gist.github.com/vjeux/f2b015d230cc1ab18ed1df30550495ed\\\">@leebyron&apos;s email on the React API</a>, this talk <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heh4OeB9A-c&amp;app=desktop\\\">&quot;How to Design a Good API and Why it Matters&quot; by Joshua Bloch</a> who designed many parts of Java, and <a href=\\\"https://hapijs.com/api\\\">Hapi.js</a>&apos; plugin design.\\n  </p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\",\"excerpt\":\"Gatsby’s APIs are tailored conceptually to some extent after React.js to improve the coherence between the two systems.

work within Gatsby’s data system, “source” and “transformer” plugins.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Source</strong> plugins “source” data from remote or local locations into what Gatsby calls <a href=\\\"/docs/node-interface/\\\">nodes</a>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Transformer</strong> plugins “transform” data provided by source plugins into new nodes and/or node fields.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For example:</p>\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/\\\"><code>gatsby-source-filesystem</code></a> plugin “sources” data about files from the file system. It creates nodes with a type <code>File</code>, each File node corresponding to a file on the filesystem. On each node are fields like the <code>absolutePath</code>, <code>extension</code>, <code>modifiedTime</code>, etc.</p>\\n<p>And importantly, each node created by the filesystem source plugin includes the raw content of the file and its <em>media type</em>.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type\\\">A <strong>media type</strong></a> (also <strong>MIME type</strong> and <strong>content type</strong>) are an official way to identify the format of files/content that is transmitted on the internet e.g. over HTTP or through email. You’re probably familiar with many media types such as <code>application/javascript</code>, <code>application/pdf</code>, <code>audio/mpeg</code>, <code>text/html</code>, <code>text/plain</code>, <code>image/jpeg</code>, etc.</p>\\n<p>Each source plugin is responsible for setting the media type for the nodes they create. This way, source and transformer plugins can work together easily.</p>\\n<p>This is not a required field but it’s the way for source plugins to indicate to transformers that there is “raw” data that can still be further processed. It allows plugins to remain small and focused. Source plugins don’t have to have opinions on how to transform their data. They can just set the <code>mediaType</code> and push that responsibility to transformer plugins.</p>\\n<p>For example, it’s quite common for services to allow you to add content as markdown. If you pull that markdown into Gatsby and create a new node, what then? How would a user of your source plugin convert that markdown into HTML they can use in their site? Luckily you don’t have to do anything. Just create a node for the markdown content and set its mediaType as <code>text/markdown</code> and the various Gatsby markdown transformer plugins will see your node and transform it into HTML.</p>\\n<p>This loose coupling between data source and transformer plugins allow Gatsby site builders to quickly assemble complex data transformation pipelines with little work on their (and your (the source plugin author)) part.</p>\\n<p>What does the code look like?</p>\\n<p>A source plugin is a normal NPM package. It has a package.json with optional dependencies as well as a <code>gatsby-node.js</code> where you implement Gatsby’s Node.js APIs. Gatsby supports back node versions back to Node 4 and as it’s common to want to use more modern node.js and JavaScript syntax, many plugins write code in a <code>src</code> directory and compile the code. All plugins maintained in the Gatsby repo follow this pattern.</p>\\n<p>Your <code>gatsby-node.js</code> should look something like:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code>exports<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>sourceNodes <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">async</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> boundActionCreators <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> createNode <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> boundActionCreators\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Create nodes here, generally by downloading data</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// from a remote API.</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> data <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">await</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">fetch</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>REMOTE_API<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// Process data into nodes.</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// data.forEach(datum =&gt; createNode(processDatum(datum)))</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// We&apos;re done, return.</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Puruse the <a href=\\\"/docs/node-apis/#sourceNodes\\\"><code>sourceNodes</code></a> and <a href=\\\"/docs/bound-action-creators/#createNode\\\"><code>createNode</code></a> docs for detailed documentation on implementing those APIs.</p>\\n<p>But at a high-level, these are the jobs of a source plugin:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Ensure local data is synced with its source and 100% accurate.

To fix this, find the offending code and either a) check before calling the code if window is defined so the code doesn’t run while gatsby is building (see code sample below) or b) if the code is in the render function of a React.js component, move that code into “componentDidMount” which ensures the code doesn’t run unless it’s in the browser.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Check that each of your JS files listed in your <code>pages</code> directory (and any sub-directories) are exporting either a React component or string.

You don’t have to be an expert in a topic to write about it—this entire Guide is open source, so even if you make a mistake, another contributor will eventually correct it.</p>\\n<p>If you’d like to help by writing an article, find a stub article in the Gatsby Guides (with an italicized title like this <em>Title</em>), write the article, then open a pull request (PR) in the Gatsby Github repo to replace the stub with your article.</p>\\n<p>If you can’t find a stub about the topic you’d like to write about, you can open a PR in Github that creates the stub and includes your draft article. Feel free to ask us questions if you’re not sure where to put a new article in the directory structure.</p>\\n<p>Before you begin writing, make sure to read the article style guide below.</p>\\n<h1 id=\\\"how-to-contribute\\\"><a href=\\\"#how-to-contribute\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>How to contribute</h1>\\n<p>You can create a PR with your draft article (or edits on an existing article) in two ways:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>The easiest method is to use the GitHub interface. Read <a href=\\\"https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/\\\">these instructions</a> on how to create a draft article or propose edits in the Github interface.</li>\\n<li>Go into the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/docs/docs\\\">“docs” folder</a> and find the article stub you’d like to write or edit. All stubs will be in an index.md file.</li>\\n<li>Click the “Edit this file” pencil icon and make your changes to the file in GitHub-flavored Markdown.</li>\\n<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and add a commit message explaining your changes. Then select the radio button option for “Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request” and click “Propose file changes”</li>\\n<li>On the next screen, you can add any other details about your PR, then click “Create pull request”.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>If you prefer to write locally before submitting a PR, then follow these steps:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Fork this repository</li>\\n<li>Copy it to your local machine by running the command <code>git clone</code> <code>https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/guides.git</code></li>\\n<li>Add a remote upstream so git knows where the official Gatsby Guides repository is located by running the command <code>git remote add upstream</code> <em>incomplete code here</em></li>\\n<li>Create a new branch for your work with the command <code>git checkout -b NEW-BRANCH-NAME</code>. Try to name your branch in a way that describes your article topic, like <code>fix/ArticleHTMLElements</code></li>\\n<li>Write your article, commit your changes locally, and push your new branch to GitHub with the command <code>git push origin NEW-BRANCH-NAME</code></li>\\n<li>Go to your repository on GitHub and open a PR</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Make sure to maintain your local fork going forward so it stays up-to-date with the Gatsby guides repository. The next time you want to contribute, checkout your local <code>master</code> branch and run the command <code>git pull --rebase upstream master</code> before creating a new branch. This will grab all the changes on the official master branch without making an additional commit in your local repository.</p>\\n<h1 id=\\\"running-the-guide-locally-on-your-own-computer\\\"><a href=\\\"#running-the-guide-locally-on-your-own-computer\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Running the Guide locally on your own computer</h1>\\n<p>Finally, if you want to run a version of the guides repository locally, follow these steps:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Ensure you have the yarn package manager installed <code>npm install -g yarn</code></li>\\n<li>Fork this repository </li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>In this project we are using <code>yarn</code> because <a href=\\\"https://www.netlify.com/\\\"><code>Netlify</code></a> builds our site with <code>yarn</code>.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"article-style-guide\\\"><a href=\\\"#article-style-guide\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Article style guide</h2>\\n<p>We’ve written the following article style guide to help you get started with contributing.</p>\\n<h1 id=\\\"table-of-contents-1\\\"><a href=\\\"#table-of-contents-1\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Table of Contents</h1>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#article-title\\\">Article title</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#modularity\\\">Modularity</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#general-writing-tips\\\">General writing tips</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#formatting-example-code\\\">Formatting example code</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#adding-images-to-articles\\\">Adding images to articles</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#proper-nouns\\\">Proper nouns</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#how-to-write-clearly\\\">How to write clearly</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h1 id=\\\"article-title\\\"><a href=\\\"#article-title\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Article title</h1>\\n<p>Article titles should be as short and clear as possible.

This helps to organize your thoughts and make the writing process easier.</p>\\n<p>Articles should be written with short, clear sentences, and use as little jargon as necessary. All jargon should be defined immediately in plain English. In other words, pretend like your readers have very little coding experience; you need to define words that beginners might have a hard time understanding.</p>\\n<p>The introduction paragraph should only be a 1-2 sentence explanation of the main topic. It should limit the use of any links to other Guide articles, as these can be distracting.</p>\\n<p>Keep paragraphs short (around 1-4 sentences). People are more likely to read several short paragraphs instead of a huge block of text.</p>\\n<p>Use active voice instead of passive voice. Generally, it’s a more concise and more straightforward way to communicate a subject. For example: - (Passive) The for loop in JavaScript is used by programmers to… - (Active) Programmers use the for loop in JavaScript to…</p>\\n<p>If you want to abbreviate a term in your article, write it out fully first, then put the abbreviation in parentheses. For example, “In computer science, an abstract syntax tree (AST) is …”</p>\\n<p>Text should use the second person (“you”) to help to give it a conversational tone. This way, the text and instructions seem to speak directly to the person reading it. Try to avoid using the first person (“I”, “we”, “let’s”, and “us”).</p>\\n<p>If there are other Guide resources you think readers would benefit from, add them at the bottom in an “Other Resources” section.</p>\\n<p>You can add diagrams, graphics, or visualizations as necessary. You can also embed relevant YouTube videos and interactive <a href=\\\"https://repl.it/\\\">REPL.it</a> code editors.</p>\\n<p>Don’t use emojis or emoticons in the Guide. Gatsby has a global community, and the cultural meaning of an emoji or emoticon may be different around the world. Also, emojis can render differently on different systems.</p>\\n<p>Format language keywords as code - this is done with the backtick key (located to the left of the “1” key on a US keyboard) in GitHub-flavored markdown. For example, put backticks around HTML tag names or CSS property names.</p>\\n<p>Use the Oxford Comma when possible (it is a comma used after the penultimate item in a list of three or more items, before ‘and’ or ‘or’ e.g. an Italian painter, sculptor, and architect). It makes things easier, clearer, and prettier to read.</p>\\n<h1 id=\\\"formatting-example-code\\\"><a href=\\\"#formatting-example-code\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Formatting example code</h1>\\n<p>Readers will likely use Guide articles as a quick reference to look up syntax.

You’ll likely go through several rounds of proofreading and editing before you’re happy with your writing.</p>\\n<p>Use the <a href=\\\"http://www.hemingwayapp.com/\\\">Hemingway App</a>. There’s nothing magical about this simple tool, but it will automatically detect widely agreed-upon style issues:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>passive voice</li>\\n<li>unnecessary adverbs</li>\\n<li>words that have more common equivalents</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The Hemingway App will assign a “grade level” for your writing. You should aim for a grade level of 6. Another tool available is the De-Jargonizer, originally designed for scientific communication but might help avoid overspecialized wording.</p>\\n<p>Also, there’s a community of support from a whole team of contributors, whom you can bounce ideas off of and ask for input on your writing. Stay active in the contributors chat room and ask lots of questions.</p>\\n<p>With your help, we can create a comprehensive reference tool that will help millions of people who are learning to code for years to come.</p>\",\"excerpt\":\"The Gatsby community is building out a more comprehensive Guides section.

E.g. markdown files would be rendered by a wrapper component at <code>wrappers/md.js</code> and JSON files <code>wrappers/json.js</code>, etc. Data would be parsed from the files and automatically injected into the wrapper components as props.</p>\\n<p><strong>If you’re <em>not</em> using wrappers in your site, feel free to skip this section.</strong></p>\\n<p>While this proved often intuitive and workable, it was overly prescriptive and restricted the types of pages that could be created due to the required 1-to-1 relationship between files and pages.</p>\\n<p>So for v1, we’re moving to a mode where sites must explicitly create pages and create mappings between template components and data.</p>\\n<p>Gatsby’s new data system turns your data into a queryable database. You can query data in any way to create pages and to pull in data into these pages.</p>\\n<p>These mappings can range between straightforward and complex. E.g. a markdown blog would want to create a post page for every markdown file. But it also might want to create tag pages for each tag linking to the posts using that tag.

The <code>name</code> and <code>version</code> fields are read from the package file. The name is used to identify the plugin when it mutates the GraphQL data structure. The version is used to clear the cache when it changes.</p>\\n<p>For local plugins it is best to leave the version field empty. Gatsby will generate an md5-hash from all gatsby-* file contents and use that as the version. This way the cache is automatically flushed when you change the code of your plugin.</p>\\n<p>If the name is empty it is inferred from the plugin folder name.</p>\\n<p>Like all gatsby-* files, the code is not being processed by Babel. If you want to use JavaScript syntax which isn’t supported by your version of Node.js, you can place the files in a <code>src</code> subfolder and build them to the plugin folder root.</p>\\n<h2

现在我们来学习如何在Gatsby网站中使用数据。</p>\\n<p>什么是数据？</p>\\n<p>一个非常计算机科学的答案是：数据就像“字符串”，整数（42），对象（{pizza：true}）等等</p>\\n<p>然而，为了在Gatsby工作，更有用的答案是“React组件之外的所有东西”。</p>\\n<p>到目前为止，我们一直在编写文本，并直接在组件中添加图像。 这是建立多个网站的绝佳方式。 但是，通常要将数据存储在组件之外，然后根据需要将数据导入组件。</p>\\n<p>例如，如果您使用Wordpress构建网站（所以其他贡献者具有良好的添加和维护内容的界面）和Gatsby，则网站（网页和帖子）的数据在Wordpress中，并根据需要将数据提取到 你的组件。</p>\\n<p>数据也可以生活在像Markdown，CSV等文件类型，以及各种数据库和API。</p>\\n<p>Gatsby的数据层让我们可以将数据从这些（以及其他来源）中直接导入到我们的组件中 - 以我们想要的形式。</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"gatsby的数据层如何使用graphql将数据提取到组件中\\\"><a

其中最流行和最健壮的是一种名为GraphQL的技术。</p>\\n<p>GraphQL是在Facebook发明的，以帮助产品工程师将所需的数据提取到组件中。</p>\\n<p>GraphQL是一种查询语言（它的名字的QL部分）。 如果您熟悉SQL，它的工作方式非常类似。 您可以在组件中使用特殊的语法描述所需的数据，然后将数据提供给您。</p>\\n<p>Gatsby使用GraphQL让组件声明它需要的数据，然后将这些数据提供给组件。</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"我们的第一个graphql查询\\\"><a

你操纵Gatsby的输入，你看到在屏幕上显示新的输出。</p>\\n<p>所以几乎在任何地方，你所做的改变都会立即生效。</p>\\n<p>尝试在siteMetadata中编辑标题 - 将标题改回“大熊猫吃很多”。 浏览器中的变化应该会很快显示出来。</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"介绍graphiql\\\"><a

有了这套功能强大的运算符，我们可以根据需要的格式选择我们想要的任何数据。</p>\\n<p>在我们的索引页的查询中，将allMarkdownRemark改为allMarkdownRemark（sort：{fields：[frontmatter___date]，order：DESC}）。 保存这个，排序顺序应该是固定的。</p>\\n<p>尝试打开GraphiQL并使用不同的排序选项。

我们有一个很好的索引页，我们正在查询我们的降价文件。 但我们不想看到摘录，我们希望我们的降价文件的实际页面。</p>\\n<p>让我们开始吧。</p>\\n<p>到目前为止，我们已经通过在src/pages中放置React组件来创建页面。 现在我们将学习如何以编程方式从数据创建页面。 Gatsby并不局限于像许多静态站点生成器一样从文件中创建页面。 Gatsby允许您使用GraphQL来查询数据并将数据映射到页面 - 所有这些都是在构建时完成的。 这是一个非常强大的想法。 我们将在本教程的其余部分探讨其含义和使用方法。</p>\\n<p>创建新页面有两个步骤，1）为页面生成“路径”或“段落”，2）创建页面。</p>\\n<p>要创建我们的Markdown页面，我们将学习使用两个Gatsby API onCreateNode和createPages。 这些是您将会看到在许多网站和插件中使用的两个主力API。</p>\\n<p>API很容易实现。 要实现一个API，只需从gatsby-node.js中导出一个带有API名称的函数。</p>\\n<p>所以让我们来做。 在您的网站的根目录中，创建一个名为gatsby-node.js的文件。 然后添加以下内容。 无论何时创建（或更新）新节点，此功能都将由盖茨比（Gatsby）调用。</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code>exports<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span

often living even within the same file.</p>\\n<p>While a seemingly simple change, it has profound implications for how you think about building websites.</p>\\n<p>Take the simple example of creating a custom button. In the past you would create a CSS class (perhaps <code>.primary-button</code>) with your custom styles and then whenever you want to apply those styles e.g.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-html\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>button</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">class</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&quot;</span>primary-button<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&quot;</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&gt;</span></span>\\n  Click me\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>button</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&gt;</span></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>In the world of components, you instead create a <code>PrimaryButton</code> component with your button styles and use it throughout your site like:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-jsx\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>PrimaryButton</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&gt;</span></span>Click me<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>PrimaryButton</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&gt;</span></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Components become the base building blocks of your site. Instead of being limited to what the browser provides e.g. <code>&#x3C;button></code>, you can easily create new building blocks that elegantly meet the needs of your projects.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"creating-global-styles\\\"><a href=\\\"#creating-global-styles\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Creating global styles</h2>\\n<p>Every site has some sort of global style. This includes things like the site’s typography and background colors. These styles set the overall feel of the site—much like the color and texture of a wall sets the overall feel of a room.</p>\\n<p>Often people will use something like Bootstrap or Foundation for their global styles. The problem with these, however, is they’re difficult to customize and they’re not designed to work well with React components.</p>\\n<p>So for this tutorial let’s explore a JavaScript library called <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kyleamathews/typography.js\\\">Typography.js</a> that generates global styles and works particularly well with Gatsby and React.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"typographyjs\\\"><a href=\\\"#typographyjs\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Typography.js</h3>\\n<p>Typography.js is a JavaScript library which generates typographic CSS.</p>\\n<p>Instead of directly setting the <code>font-size</code> of different HTML elements, you tell Typography.js things like your desired <code>baseFontSize</code> and <code>baseLineHeight</code> and based on these, it generates the base CSS for all your elements.</p>\\n<p>This makes it trivial to change the font size of all elements on a site without having to directly modify the dozens of CSS rules.</p>\\n<p>Using it looks something like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> Typography <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&quot;typography&quot;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> typography <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">Typography</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  baseFontSize<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&apos;18px&apos;</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  baseLineHeight<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">1.45</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  headerFontFamily<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">&apos;Avenir Next&apos;</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&apos;Helvetica Neue&apos;</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&apos;Segoe UI&apos;</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&apos;Helvetica&apos;</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&apos;Arial&apos;</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&apos;sans-serif&apos;</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  bodyFontFamily<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">&apos;Georgia&apos;</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&apos;serif&apos;</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"gatsby-plugins\\\"><a href=\\\"#gatsby-plugins\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Gatsby plugins</h2>\\n<p>But before we can get back to building and trying out Typography.js, let’s make a quick diversion and talk about Gatsby plugins.</p>\\n<p>You’re probably familiar with the idea of plugins. Many software systems support adding custom plugins to add new functionality or even modify the core workings of the software.</p>\\n<p>Gatsby plugins work the same way.</p>\\n<p>Community members (like you!) can contribute plugins (small amounts of JavaScript code) that others can then use when building Gatsby sites.</p>\\n<p>There’s already dozens of plugins! Check them out at the <a href=\\\"/docs/plugins/\\\">plugins section of the site</a>.</p>\\n<p>Gatsby plugins are easy to install and use. In almost every Gatsby site you build, you will be installing plugins. While working through the rest of the tutorial, you’ll have many opportunities to practice installing and using plugins.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"installing-your-first-gatsby-plugin\\\"><a href=\\\"#installing-your-first-gatsby-plugin\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Installing your first Gatsby plugin</h2>\\n<p>Let’s start by creating a new site. Similar to Part One, run the following to create a new site.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>gatsby new tutorial-part-two https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This creates a new site with the following structure.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-shell\\\"><code>&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; package.json\\n&#x251C;&#x2500;&#x2500; src\\n&#x2502;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500; pages\\n&#x2502;&#xA0;&#xA0;     &#x2514;&#x2500;&#x2500; index.js</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This is the minimal setup for a Gatsby site.</p>\\n<p>To install a plugin, there’s two steps. First you install the plugin’s NPM package and second you add the plugin to your site’s <code>gatsby-config.js</code>.</p>\\n<p>Typography.js has a Gatsby plugin, so let’s install that by running:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-shell\\\"><code>npm install --save gatsby-plugin-typography</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Next, create a file at the root of your project folder named <code>gatsby-config.js</code>. This is where you add plugins to a site along with other site configuration.</p>\\n<p>Copy the following into <code>gatsby-config.js</code></p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code>module<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>exports <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  plugins<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span><span class=\\\"token template-string\\\"><span class=\\\"token string\\\">`gatsby-plugin-typography`</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Gatsby reads the site’s config file when starting.

Try changing the <code>baseFontSize</code> to <code>24px</code> then <code>12px</code>. All elements get resized as their <code>font-size</code> is based on the <code>baseFontSize</code>.</p>\\n<p>There are <a href=\\\"https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typography.js#published-typographyjs-themes\\\">many themes available</a> for Typography.js.

Let’s explore three very popular and production-ready options. We’ll build a simple page three times to explore each styling option.</p>\\n<p>Each is a variant on “CSS-in-JS”—which solves many of the problems with traditional CSS.</p>\\n<p>One of the most important problems they solve is selector name collisions. With traditional CSS, you have to be careful not to overwrite CSS selectors used elsewhere in a site because all CSS selectors live in the same global namespace. This unfortunate restriction can lead to elaborate (and often confusing) selector naming schemes.</p>\\n<p>With CSS-in-JS, you avoid all that as CSS selectors are scoped automatically to their component. Styles are tightly coupled with their components. This makes it very easy to know how to edit a component’s CSS as there’s never any confusion about how and where CSS is being used.</p>\\n<p>For some background reading on CSS-in-JS, see <a href=\\\"https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js\\\">Christopher “vjeux” Chedeau’s 2014 presentation that sparked this movement</a> as well as <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/seek-blog/a-unified-styling-language-d0c208de2660\\\">Mark Dalgleish’s more recent post “A Unified Styling Language”</a>.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"css-modules\\\"><a href=\\\"#css-modules\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>CSS Modules</h3>\\n<p>Let’s explore first <strong>CSS Modules</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Quoting from <a href=\\\"https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules\\\">the CSS Module homepage</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>A <strong>CSS Module</strong> is a CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>CSS Modules is very popular, as it lets you write CSS like normal but with a lot more safety. The tool automatically makes class and animation names unique so you don’t have to worry about selector name collisions.</p>\\n<p>CSS Modules are highly recommended for those new to building with Gatsby (and React in general).</p>\\n<p>Gatsby works out of the box with CSS Modules.</p>\\n<p>Let’s build a page using CSS Modules.</p>\\n<p>First, let’s create a new <code>Container</code> component which we’ll use for each of the CSS-in-JS examples. Create a <code>components</code> directory at <code>src/components</code> and then, in this directory, create a file named <code>container.js</code> and paste the following.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> React <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&quot;react&quot;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">default</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> children <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span>div style<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> margin<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&quot;3rem auto&quot;</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> maxWidth<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">600</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>children<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">/</span>div<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Then create a new component page by creating a file at <code>src/pages/about-css-modules.js</code>:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> React <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&quot;react&quot;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> Container <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">&quot;../components/container&quot;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">default</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span>Container<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span>h1<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&gt;</span>About CSS Modules<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">/</span>h1<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span>p<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&gt;</span>CSS Modules are cool<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">/</span>p<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&gt;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">/</span>Container<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>You’ll notice we imported the <code>Container</code> component we just created.</p>\\n<p>Your page should now look like:</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p>Let’s create a simple list of people with names, avatars, and short latin biographies.</p>\\n<p>First, let’s create the file for the CSS at <code>src/pages/about-css-modules.module.css</code>. You’ll notice that the file name ends with <code>.module.css</code> instead of <code>.css</code> like normal. This is how we tell Gatsby that this CSS file should be processed as CSS modules.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-css\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.user</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">display</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> flex<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">align-items</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> center<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">margin</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 0 auto 12px auto<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.user:last-child</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">margin-bottom</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 0<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.avatar</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">flex</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 0 0 96px<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">width</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 96px<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">height</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 96px<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">margin</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 0<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.description</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">flex</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 1<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">margin-left</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 18px<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">padding</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 12px<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.username</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">margin</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 0 0 12px 0<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">padding</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 0<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.excerpt</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">margin</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 0<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Now import that file into the <code>about-css-modules.js</code> page we created earlier.

These are the class names CSS Modules generates. They’re guaranteed to be unique across your site. And because you have to import them to use the classes, there’s never any question about where some CSS is being used.</p>\\n<p>Let’s use our styles to create a simple <code>User</code> component.</p>\\n<p>Let’s create the new component inline in the <code>about-css-modules.js</code> page component. The general rule of thumb is if you use a component in multiple places on a site, it should be in its own module file in the <code>components</code> directory. But, if it’s used only in one file, create it inline.</p>\\n<p>Modify <code>about-css-modules.js</code> so it looks like the following:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre

在过去，你会创建一个CSS类（可能.primary-button）与你的自定义样式，然后当你想要应用这些样式，例如</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-html\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>button</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">class</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&quot;</span>primary-button<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&quot;</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&gt;</span></span>\\n  Click me\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>button</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&gt;</span></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>在组件的世界中，您可以使用按钮样式创建一个PrimaryButton组件，并在整个站点中使用它，如下所示：</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-jsx\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>PrimaryButton</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&gt;</span></span>Click me<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>PrimaryButton</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&gt;</span></span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>组件成为您网站的基础构建块。 而不仅限于浏览器提供的内容，例如 <button></button>，您可以轻松地创建优雅地满足项目需求的新建筑模块。 </p>\\n<h2>\\n

有一些官方的的“starters”和许多其他从Gatsby社区贡献的“starters”！ 详细信息请查看 Starters页面</p>\\n<p>要安装starter，首先在终端窗口中输入以下命令来安装Gatsby的终端程序，然后按下ENTER键。</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-sh\\\"><code>npm install --global gatsby-cli</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>安装完成后，在中输入以下命令并按Enter键：</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-sh\\\"><code>gatsby new tutorial-part-one https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>该命令下载启动程序的文件，然后安装所需的NPM软件包。 完成大约需要1.5-3分钟。 一开始可能看起来没有任何事情发生， 耐心一点！</p>\\n<p>现在我们来试试运行Gatsby！</p>\\n<p>Gatsby有一个内置的开发服务器。 让我们通过在本教程中使用的终端窗口中输入以下命令来启动它。</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-sh\\\"><code>cd

</p>\\n<p>这样，它就开始工作了！</p>\\n<p>是不是很酷？ </p>\\n<p>Gatsby的开发服务器是一个“热加载”服务器，这意味着您对React.js页面组件（以及后来我们将了解的，您的数据文件）所做的任何更改都将在浏览器中重新加载。</p>\\n<p>这是它最大的优点，因为它使开发更快更有趣。</p>\\n<p>让我们试一下!</p>\\n<p>本教程的下一部分需要使用代码编辑软件。 VS Code是一个不错的选择。 使用代码编辑器，在计算机上打开一个名为“tutorial-part-one”的文件夹。 当你在本教程的第一部分中运行先前的终端命令时，该文件夹是自动创建的。</p>\\n<p>现在，您已经在代码编辑软件中打开了“tutorial-part-one”文件夹，现在可以编辑您的网站了。 在代码编辑软件中，您需要找到<code></code> src/pages/index.js&#x3C;/ code>。 一旦你发现，尝试在页面组件中把“Hello World！”修改为 “Hello Gatsby！”。 浏览器中的文本会随着改变。</p>\\n<p>&#x5C1D;&#x8BD5;&#x4E00;&#x4E9B;&#x5176;&#x4ED6;&#x7684;&#x6280;&#x5DE7;&#xFF0C;&#x5982;&#x4E0B;&#x6240;&#x793A;&#xFF1A;</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><p>Gatsby&#x5141;&#x8BB8;&#x60A8;&#x901A;&#x8FC7;JavaScript&#x98CE;&#x683C;&#x7684;&#x201C;prop&#x201D;&#x5C5E;&#x6027;&#x6DFB;&#x52A0;&#x201C;&#x5185;&#x8054;&#x98CE;&#x683C;&#x201D;&#xFF08;&#x7A0D;&#x540E;&#x6211;&#x4EEC;&#x5C06;&#x4E86;&#x89E3;&#x5176;&#x4ED6;&#x6837;&#x5F0F;&#x9009;&#x9879;&#xFF09;&#x3002;</p></li></ol>\\n<p>&#x5C1D;&#x8BD5;&#x4F7F;&#x60A8;&#x7684;&#x9875;&#x9762;&#x7EC4;&#x4EF6;&#x5982;&#x4E0B;&#x6240;&#x793A;&#xFF1A;</p>\\n\\n<pre><code

href=\\\"https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router-dom/docs/api/Link.md\\\">React Router’s Link component</a> that adds enhancements specific to Gatsby. All props are passed through\\nto React Router’s Link.</p>\\n<p>You can set the <code>activeStyle</code> or <code>activeClassName</code> prop to add styling attributes to the rendered element when it matches the current URL. If either of these props are set, then <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router-dom/docs/api/NavLink.md\\\">React Router’s NavLink component</a> will be used instead of Link.</p>\\n<p>Gatsby does per-route code splitting. This means that when navigating to a new\\npage, the code chunks necessary for that page might not be loaded. This is bad.\\nAny unnecessary latency when changing pages should be avoided. So to avoid that\\nGatsby preloads code chunks and page data. Preloading is triggered by a link\\nentering the viewport so it only prefetchs code/data chunks for pages the user\\nis likely to navigate to.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"install\\\"><a href=\\\"#install\\\"

For example, if you add a link to the the root wildcard path (<code>/*</code>), it will be replaced by any more specific path. If you want a resource to put linked across the site, you will have to add to every path.

want to highlight lines of code, you also need to add some additional\\nCSS that targets our <em>custom line highlighting implementation</em> (which slightly\\ndiffers from PrismJS’s own plugin for that – more on that later).</p>\\n<p>For simple line highlights similar to PrismJS’s, try:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-css\\\"><code><span
