Gatsby sites <em>render</em> a static HTML version of the initial route and then load the code bundle for the page. Then immediately starts <em>pre-caching</em> resources for pages\nlinked to from the initial route. When a user clicks on a link, Gatsby creates the new page <em>on demand</em> on\nthe client.</p>\n<p>This issue written at the start of Gatsby’s 1.0 work provides further background on how\nGatsby works to guarantee high performance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/431\">https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/431</a></p>",
