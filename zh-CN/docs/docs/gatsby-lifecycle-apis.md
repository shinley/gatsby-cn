title: Gatsby生命周期API
---
Gatsby提供了一组丰富的生命周期API，以便挂钩Gatsby的引导，构建和客户端运行时操作。

Gatsby的设计原则包括：

* Conventions > code but use low-level primitives to build conventions with code.
* Extracting logic and configuration into [plugins](/docs/plugins/) should be trivial and encouraged.
* Plugins are easy to open source and reuse. They're just NPM packages.

See the links along the left under "REFERENCE" for the full API documentation.
