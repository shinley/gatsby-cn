title: Gatsby Lifecycle APIs
---

Gatsby provides a rich set of lifecycle APIs to hook into Gatsby's bootstrap, build, and
client runtime operations.

Gatsby's design principles include:

* Conventions > code but use low-level primitives to build conventions with code.
* Extracting logic and configuration into [plugins](/docs/plugins/) should be trivial and encouraged.
* Plugins are easy to open source and reuse. They're just NPM packages.

See the links along the left under "REFERENCE" for the full API documentation.
