title: How Gatsby Works with GitHub Pages
---

The easiest way to push a gatsby app to GitHub Pages is using a package called `gh-pages`.

`npm install gh-pages --save-dev`

## GitHub repository page

Add a `deploy` script to `package.json`

        {
            scripts: {
                "deploy": "gatsby build --prefix-paths && gh-pages -d public",
            }
        }
    

We are using prefix paths because our website is inside a folder `http://username.github.io/reponame/` so we need to add pathPrefix to `gatsby-config.js`

    {
        pathPrefix: "/reponame"
    }
    

When you run `npm run deploy` all contents of `public` folder will be moved to your repositorys `gh-pages` branch.

## GitHub Organization or User page

First thing is to create a repository which should be named `username.github.io`.

In this case we dont need to specify `pathPrefix`, but our website needs to be pushed to `master` branch.

        {
            scripts: {
                ...
                "deploy": "gatsby build && gh-pages -d public -b master",
            }
        }
    

After running `npm run deploy` you should see your website at `http://username.github.io`

## Custom domains

If you use a [custom domain](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/), don't add a `pathPrefix` as it will break navigation on your site. Path prefixing is only necessary when the site is *not* at the root of the domain like with repository sites.
