# gatsby-transformer-yaml

Parses YAML files. Supports arrays of objects and single objects.

## Install

`npm install --save gatsby-transformer-yaml`

You also need to have `gatsby-source-filesystem` installed and configured so it points to your files.

## How to use

```javascript
// In your gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  `gatsby-transformer-yaml`,
]
```

## Parsing algorithm

You can choose to structure your data as arrays of objects in individual files
or as single objects spread across multiple files.

### Array of Objects

The algorithm for YAML arrays is to convert each item in the array into
a node. The type of the node is based on the filename.

So if your project has a `letters.yaml` which looks like:

```yaml
- value: a
- value: b
- value: c
```

Then the following three nodes would be created.

```javascript
[
  {
    value: 'a',
    type: 'Letters',
  },
  {
    value: 'b',
    type: 'Letters',
  },
  {
    value: 'c',
    type: 'Letters',
  },
]
```

### Single Object

The algorithm for single YAML objects is to convert the object defined at the
root of the file into a node. The type of the node is based on the name of the
parent directory.

For example, lets say your project has a data layout like:

```
data/
    letters/
        a.yml
        b.yml
        c.yml
```

Where each of `a.yml`, `b.yml` and `c.yml` look like:

```yaml
value: a
```

```yaml
value: b
```

```yaml
value: c
```

Then the following three nodes would be created.

```javascript
[
  {
    value: 'a',
    type: 'Letters',
  },
  {
    value: 'b',
    type: 'Letters',
  },
  {
    value: 'c',
    type: 'Letters',
  },
]
```

## How to query

Regardless of whether you choose to structure your data in arrays of objects or
single objects, you'd be able to query your letters like:

```graphql
{
  allLetters {
    edges {
      node {
        value
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Which would return:

```javascript
{
  allLetters: {
    edges: [
      {
        node: {
          value: 'a'
        }
      },
      {
        node: {
          value: 'b'
        }
      },
      {
        node: {
          value: 'c'
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
