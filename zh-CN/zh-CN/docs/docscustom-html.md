title: 自定义html.js
---
Gatsby uses a React component to server render the `<head>` and other parts of the HTML outside of the core Gatsby application.

Most sites should use the default `html.js` shipped with Gatsby. But if you need to customize your site's html.js, copy the default one into your source tree by running:

```shell
cp .cache/default-html.js src/html.js
```

然后根据需要进行修改。

### 必需的属性

Note: the various props that are rendered into pages *are* required e.g. `headComponents`, `preBodyComponents`, `body`, and `postBodyComponents`.

### React Helmet

Also anything you render in the `html.js` component will *not* be made "live" in the client like other components. If you want to dynamically update your `<head>` we recommend using [React Helmet](/packages/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet/)

### 目标容器

If you see this error: `Uncaught Error: _registerComponent(...): Target container is not a DOM element.` it means your `html.js` is missing the required "target container". Inside your `<body>` you must have a div with an id of `___gatsby` like:

```jsx
<div
  key={`body`}
  id="___gatsby"
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: this.props.body }}
/>
```

### Adding custom JavaScript

You can add custom JavaScript to your HTML document by using React's [dangerouslySetInnerHTML](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#dangerouslysetinnerhtml) attribute.

```jsx
<script
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: `
            var name = 'world';
            console.log('Hello ' + name);
        `,
  }}
/>
```
